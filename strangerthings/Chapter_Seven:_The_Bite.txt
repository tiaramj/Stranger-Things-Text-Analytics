[band stops]
Kline: Now, doesn't that just lift your spirits?
[cheering]
Kline: Let's give another big hand for the Hawkins High Marching Band!
[cheering]
Kline: I hope you're all having a good time tonight.
[crowd cheers]
Kline: Are you having a good time?
[cheering]
Kline: I can't hear you! Are you having a good time?
[loud cheering]
Kline: [chuckles] I want you to know that we spared no expense to provide you with the very best entertainment that money can buy!
Worker: Keep your arms inside.
Karen: Uh-oh! Dad can't get out now.
Ted: Why do you two enjoy torturing me?
Karen: Because it's fun.
Holly: Yeah, Dad, 'cause it's fun!
Karen: Oh, here we go.
Ted: [groans as the Ferris wheel spins] Oh, boy. Hoo!
Kline: But enough of me blabbering. Who here wants to see some fireworks?
[cheering]
Kline: Come on, now, you can do better than that. Who here wants to see some fireworks?
[loud cheering]
["Semper Fidelis" playing]
[Karen sighs]
Ted: Uh, why are we stopping?
Karen: Because I slipped Jimmy a five.
Ted: You what?
Karen: Come on, these are the best seats in the house.
Holly: The best seats in the house.
[fireworks popping]
Karen: Oh!
Kline: Happy Fourth of July!
[cheering]
[Karen: Whoa! [laughing] That was pretty, wasn't it?
Yeah. Yeah.
[Karen gasps]
[ominous synth music playing]
[rustling in trees]
Holly: Mom, the trees.
Karen: What, baby?
Holly: The trees are moving.
[rustling continues]
Karen: Why are you looking at the trees, baby? The fireworks. Look at the fireworks! [laughs] That was a big one, wasn't it?
[thudding footsteps]
[creature snarling]
[fireworks popping and crackling distantly]
[crowd cheering distantly]
[marching band playing distantly]
Eleven: He said he was building something. That it was all for me.
Max: Building something... Is he talking about the flayed?
Nancy: He must be.
Lucas: So, he's building an army, just like we thought.
Mike: Yeah, but he's not building this army to spread.
Will: He's building it to stop Eleven.
Mike: Last year, El closed the gate on him. I have a feeling that really pissed him off.
Lucas: Like, royally.
Mike: And the Mind Flayer now knows that she's the only thing that can stop him. But if she's out of the way-
Lucas: Game over.
Eleven: He also said he was gonna kill all of you.
Max: Yeah, well, that's nice.
[faint screeching noise]
[Nancy walks over to the window]
[ominous synth music playing]
[faint screeching noise]
Nancy: Do you guys hear that? [shudders]
Jonathan: It's just the fireworks.
[Eleven nods]
[distant thudding noise]
[fluttering sound]
Will: [reaches for his neck to feel the goosebumps] He knows we're here.
[they leave the house and see the creature on the hill]
[trees rustling]
[creature snarls]
[creature screeches]
[alarm blaring]
[Dustin is driving a transport vehicle with Steve and Robin in the back]
Steve: [slurring] Jesus, slow down!
Robin: [slurring] Yeah, what is this, like, the Indy 500?
Steve: It's the Indy 300.
Robin: No, dingus, it's 500!
Steve: It's 300!
Robin: Let's say a million.
[both laughing loudly]
Erica: What is wrong with them?
Dustin: I don't know
Erica: Dustin, watch out!
Dustin: Shit!
Steve: [grunts, yells as the vehicle suddenly stops] Oh!
[Robin groans]
Dustin: You guys all right back there?
[both groaning]
Dustin: They're fine.
[Dustin and Erica get out and let Steve and Robin out]
Dustin: Come on. We gotta go, now.
Erica: Come on! Get out!
Dustin: Let's go! [pulls them both out with Erica]
Steve: Ow! We're coming!
Dustin: Here goes nothin'.
[he uses the keycard on the elevator]
Steve: This sucks.
[beeping]
[they get in the elevator and go up]
[Robin and Steve whooping giddily as Steve stands on a trolley]
Robin: Hey! You look like you're surfing!
Steve: Surfing! Yeah! Whoa!
Erica: They seem drunk.
Dustin: Why would they be drunk?
Steve: I'm a natural! Check it out! Whoop!
[Robin laughs as she pulls the trolley out from under him]
Robin: Wipeout!
[both laughing]
Dustin: He's burning up.
Steve: You're burning up.
Dustin: One sec, one sec. Steve, Steve.
Steve: God, no. 
[Dustin checks his eyes]
Steve: Ow!
Dustin: His pupils are super dilated.
Erica: Maybe he's drugged.
Steve: Ugh. Boop!
Dustin: Steve, are you drugged?
Steve: How many times, Dad? I don't do drugs. It's only marijuana.
Dustin: This isn't funny, okay? I need to know what they did to you. Are you gonna die on us?
Steve: Boop.
Robin: We all die, my strange little child friend. It's just a matter of how... and when.
Dustin: They're gonna be looking for us up there, so I need you to tell me where you parked your car.
Steve: Oh, can we make a pit stop at the food court?
Robin: I would kill for a hot dog on a stick.
Steve: Ooh!
Dustin: All right. Yeah, food. Yes, you can have as much food as you want, but only if you tell me where your car is parked.
Steve: Uh-oh.
Dustin: Uh-oh?
Steve: The car's off the board.
Dustin: What?
Steve: They took the keys. The Russians, they took the keys. Like, forever ago.
[Robin and Steve laugh]
Steve: That's a bummer, right?
[they leave the elevator and walk outside]
Robin: [laughing] Oh! Oh, my God, that tastes so good. Ah! Steve, can you taste the air?
Steve: I taste it! I taste it!
[Dustin and Erica see two guards walking towards them]
Robin: Stop!
Dustin: Shit! Come on! Come on!
[kids clamoring]
Soldier: [in Russian] Stop right there!
Robin: Okay, okay, okay! Woo!
Steve: Why are we running?
[Robin laughing as they go into Starcourt]
[Nancy opens the shed and looks around]
[she grabs the shotgun as Jonathan grabs the axe]
[the kids start barricading the cabin]
[Eleven grunting]
Mike: Yeah. That's good like that.
Nancy: Hey, get away from the windows.
[all panting, they stand in the middle of the cabin]
[lamp squeaking]
[rumbling]
[electric crackling]
[gasping]
[breathing rapidly]
Will: It's close.
[leaves rustling]
[branches snapping]
[rumbling footsteps]
[glasses clinking]
[rumbling stops]
Max: Where'd it go?
[Nancy exhales sharply]
[shuddering breaths]
[creature shrieks and breaks through the wall]
[all gasping and moving out the way of the tendril]
[Jonathan yells, grunts as he pulls the tendril away from Eleven using the axe]
[creature shrieks]
[Jonathan grunts and sinks the axe into the tendril again]
[Jonathan yells as it throws him into a wall]
[he grunts]
[the creature shrieks, the tendril now going after Jonathan]
[Jonathan groans]
[Nancy shoots the tendril, the creature shrieks]
[creature wails, screeching because Nancy won't stop shooting it]
[it shrieks and backs her into the wall when she runs out of bullets]
[creature wails as it's held back by El, shrieking in pain]
[Mike gasps]
[creature shrieking]
[creature screams]
[Eleven yells]
[creature shrieks as Eleven rips the mouth off the tendril]
[Max yelps as the tendril passes her out the hole in the wall]
Max: Holy shit.
[another tendril shoots into the cabin, shrieking]
[glass shatters as another enters the cabin, El holding them both]
[both tendrils shrieking]
[Eleven panting]
[creatures shrieking]
[shrieking and barking]
[Eleven yells and rips the tendrils again]
[the tendrils retreat again, whimpering shrieks heard]
[Eleven panting]
[a tendril comes in from the roof, grabbing Eleven's leg, roaring and shrieking]
[Eleven screams as it lifts her]
Mike: [grabs her] El!
[Eleven screaming]
Mike: El!
[all the kids grab Eleven, grunting]
[creature roaring]
[Nancy pumps shotgun, reloading]
[creature roaring]
Mike: Pull!
Jonathan: Nancy, shoot it!
[Eleven screaming]
[creature snarling]
[Nancy shoots it]
[the creature lets out pained snarls] 
[Eleven screams]
Max: Come on! Lucas!
[Nancy pumps shotgun]
[Lucas grabs the axe and yells, hacking at the tendril]
[creature roars]
[Lucas grunts, yells]
[shotgun fires]
[creature roaring]
[Eleven screaming]
[kids straining, pulling Eleven]
[creature roars]
[Lucas yells, hacking at the tendril]
Max: Pull!
[shotgun fires]
[creature screeches]
[Lucas cuts the tendril, it squelching]
[creature roaring]
Mike; [holds Eleven close] El! El, you okay?
[creature roaring]
[Mike sees the mouth of the tendril is still attached to Eleven's leg, it shrieking]
[he pulls it off her leg, Eleven screeching in pain]
[monstrous chittering as Mike throws it and it leaves the cabin]
[creature snarls]
[Eleven panting heavily]
[creature roaring as Eleven stands up]
[Eleven panting]
[creature shrieking]
[creature roaring]
[Eleven uses her powers, yelling]
[pained screeching from the creature as it starts ripping apart]
[Eleven yells]
[distant roaring]
[Max grabs Eleven and helps her]
Nancy: Go, go, go!
Jonathan: Come on, come on, go!
Nancy: Go!
Jonathan: [taking down the barricade] Hurry up! Come on!
Mike: Everybody out!
Jonathan: Go!
Nancy: Go, come on!
[creature roars as they run to the car]
Jonathan: Go, go, go, go!
Lucas: [opens the doors] Come on!
Nancy: [repeating] Come on!
Lucas: Come on! Come on!
[creature shrieking]
Jonathan: Get in. Right here.
[Eleven wails in pain]
Mike: Drive! Drive!
[engine starting]
[Nancy drives off, the creature roaring]
[Dustin and Erica pull Steve and Robin through the corridors of Starcourt]
Steve: Whoa!
Robin: Where are we going?
Dustin: Just trust me.
[Robin laughs]
[Dustin looks through the door and heads through]
Dustin: All clear.
[they head into the movie theatre and Steve grabs some popcorn from the trash]
[score from Back to the Future playing]
Marty: Doc! 
Doc: What did I tell you?! Eighty-eight miles per hour!
Dustin: Come on.
[he finds them seats and sits down]
[metal clanging in movie]
Doc: [gasps] The temporal displacement occurred exactly 1:20..
Dustin: You two, sit.
Robin: No, no, no! These seats are too close!
Steve: Dude, these seats blow.
Dustin: Then don't watch the movie.
Robin: We wanna watch it.
Dustin: Then watch it!
Man: Shh!
Robin: Shh!
Dustin: Sorry. Whatever you do, don't... go... anywhere.
Steve: Fine, Dad.
[Robin snickers]
Doc: The appropriate question is "When the hell are they?" You see, Einstein has just become the world's first time traveler!
[Dustin and Erica moves to other spare seats]
Dustin: Sorry. Sorry.
Doc: I sent him... into the future!
[Dustin sighs]
Dustin: Okay, it's official. I'm never having kids.
Erica: What are we doing here?
Dustin: We're laying low. Cooling off. Like Oswald.
Erica: Oswald was found in a theater and shot to death.
Dustin: A week later. 
Erica: The point is, his plan didn't work.
Dustin: Only because it was a setup.
Erica: What?
Dustin: He was just a patsy.
Erica: Tell me you're joking.
Woman: Shh!
Erica and Dustin: Shh!
Erica: We need to get outta here.
Dustin: All right, you watch Tweedledee and Tweedledum. Make sure they don't go anywhere.
Erica: Where are you going?
Dustin: To find us a ride.
Doc: Look out!
[DeLorean zapping]
[brakes screeching]
Marty: Doc...
Robin: What's happening?
Steve: I have no idea.
Marty: Are you telling me that you built a time machine...
[Hopper drives Joyce, Alexei and Murray]
[Murray and Alexei are talking in the backseat]
[Alexei speaking Russian]
Hopper: What's he saying?
Murray: He's showing me the location of the key to turn off the machine. [speaking Russian] Sorry, "keys." Two keys.
[Alexei speaking Russian]
Hopper: Two-man rule.
Joyce: Two-man rule?
Hopper: Yeah, two men, two keys, like a... nuclear launch.
Murray: But, uh, to retrieve the keys, there is a vault.
[Alexei speaking Russian]
Murray: And to open the vault, you need to enter Planck's constant.
Hopper: Planck's what?
Murray: Planck's constant. It's a very famous number.
Joyce: All right, so we get the keys, and then we turn the machine off.
Murray: That's what he says.
Joyce: All right, well, that shouldn't be too hard. We can do this.
Hopper: Joyce, did you hear the part where he said the place was like an impenetrable fortress?
Joyce: Yeah, but there has to be a way in.
Hopper: Yeah, there is. Our military.
Joyce: Who are coming.
Hopper: Well, we don't know that anymore because you yelled at them like it was a parent-teacher conference, and then you hung up on them, so we don't know what the hell's going on, because now we're- Wait, wait, what are we do- Oh! Wait, that's right! We're on our way to rescue our children from the big, bad Fourth of July celebration!
Joyce: You know what, if you can't handle this, then just turn around and drop me off first.
Hopper: What are you gonna do? You gonna walk back to Hawkins?
Joyce: I will do anything if it gets me away from you! 
Murray: Children! Children! Children! This interminable bickering was amusing at first, but it's getting very stale and we've still got a long drive ahead of us. So, why don't you two cut the horseshit and get to the part where you admit your sexual feelings for one another?
Hopper: Whoa!
Joyce: You are way off base, buddy!
Murray: Oh, spare me, spare me, spare me! Yes, yes, he's a brute. I know. Probably reminds you of a bad relationship, and, gosh, you'd really like a nice man to settle down with, but, admit it, you're real curious to know what he's like in the sack. And you. Ha! Well, you're just a big manbaby who'd rather act tough than show his true feelings, because the last time you opened your heart, you got hurt. Owie. And now, rather than admit these feelings, you're dancing around one another with this mind-numbing and frankly boorish mating ritual. So, please, for my sake, either quit your bickering, or pull over, tear off those clothes, and get it over with already!
[Joyce gasps]
[Hopper doesn't react, he's just frozen and stunned]
[Murray lets out a deep sigh]
Alexei: [in Russian] What was that?
Murray: [in Russian] I told them they should have sex.
Alexei: [in Russian] They have not had sex?
Murray: [in Russian] No.
[Alexei snickers]
[Murray chuckles]
[both laughing]
[Joyce mutters]
[Alexei speaking Russian]
[both laughing]
Murray: [laughs] Oh! Oh!
[Murray and Alexei continue laughing]
[Nancy parks very recklessly for having 5 children in the car with her and Jonathan, tires squealing]
[glass shattering]
[Eleven groans as they carry her inside]
[Nancy walks to the medical aisle and grabs some rubbing alcohol and bandages]
Nancy: Okay, get her down. Okay. Lemme see.
[she pulls up Eleven's trouser leg and sees the oozing wound]
Max: Oh, shit.
[Eleven groans]
[Nancy gets out a bandage and the rubbing alcohol]
Max: What- What- Hey, what are you doing?
Nancy: I'm cleaning the wound.
Max: No, first, we need to stop the bleeding, then clean, then disinfect, then bandage. I skateboard. Trust me. Mike, hold this.
[Eleven groans as Mike puts pressure on the wound]
Max: Keep the pressure on it, nice and firm, okay? We're gonna need water, soap.
Nancy: Yeah, okay.
Jonathan: All right.
[Nancy and Jonathan rush off]
[Lucas empties out his backpack, making a mess]
[Max looks disgusted at his behaviour]
Lucas: Does any of this help?
Max: No. Go get me a washcloth and a bowl.
Lucas: A bowl?
Max: Lucas.
[Will slaps his arm like 'dude']
Will: Go.
Lucas: [stammers] Okay.
Eleven: [groans]
Nancy: What did that thing look like to you?
Jonathan: Like that thing in the hospital, only bigger.
Nancy: Yeah, a lot bigger. Like, Tom and Bruce, they merged to become one, right? And- And Driscoll kept saying how she needed to go back to the source-
Jonathan: Wait, you think Driscoll's in there?
Nancy: Maybe. And- And- And maybe Heather and Janet, too, and God knows who else. I don't know how we're gonna kill this thing, but if we do-
Jonathan: We kill all the flayed.
Nancy: And... we end this. Maybe. All I know is... we need El.
Lucas: Bowl... Bowl... Bowl... Why wouldn't it be with the cereal?
Will: I don't know.
Lucas: What else do you use a bowl for?
Will: I- I don't know.
[Lucas sighs]
Lucas: Oh, shit. 
[they see the fireworks and run over]
Lucas: Satan's Baby. You ever shot one of these suckers?
Will: No. Is it sweet?
Lucas: That's an understatement.
[Max walks over, not impressed]
Max: That doesn't look like a bowl.
Lucas: Nah, it's way better. There is a reason this warning label says "18 or older." This sucker is filled with 150 grains of black powder. AKA gunpowder. Strap two of these together, and it's bigger than an M-80. Five of them, we've got ourselves a stick of dynamite.
Max: You wanna kill that thing with fireworks?
Lucas: Do you have a better idea?
Max: Uh, yeah. Eleven.
Lucas: Against that thing? She's gonna need some backup.
Max: Oh, my God.
[she walks off and Lucas scoffs]
Lucas: Hold this.
[Will holds Satan's Baby as Lucas grabs more fireworks]
[Mike groans]
Mike: Does that hurt?
Mike: You're gonna have an awesome scar. You'll look even more badass.
Eleven: Bitchin'.
Mike: Yeah, bitchin'. [chuckles] El...
Eleven: Yeah?
Mike: I've been meaning to tell you something. It's just, being broken up, it's been hard.
[distorted radio chatter]
Mike: And... I like that you and Max are friends now. It's just, I was jealous at first, and- and angry. And that's why I said all that stupid stuff. And it's like I wanted you all to myself. And now I realize how unfair that is. And selfish. And, like... I'm sorry. I just, like, I've never felt like this, you know, with anyone before... and... [sighs] You know, they do say it makes you crazy.
Eleven: What makes you crazy?
Mike: You never- You never heard that term... You know, like the phrase, like... "blank makes you crazy," like the word...
Eleven: "Girlfriends"?
Mike: No, no, no, no, not- not girlfriends.
Eleven: "Boyfriends."
Mike: No! No, no, not boyfriends either. It's like- It's like a feeling or... 
Eleven: [softly] A feeling...
Mike: Yeah, like something... Like, old people say it to each other sometimes.
Eleven: Old people?
Mike: Yeah. What I wanna say is... that I just... I know that I-
[Dustin speaking via radio, garbled]
[static popping]
Dustin: [distorted via radio] I repeat... this is a code red!
[score from Back to the Future plays]
Mike: Dustin?
Dustin: Mike?
Mike: Dustin!
Dustin: Mike! Oh, my God, you have to listen. I know I've been MIA, and I'm sorry, it's not because I'm mad. I mean, I actually was mad, but it's also because I was trapped underground in a secret Russian base.
[garbled radio audio]
Mike: Dustin, you're going way too fast. I can't understand you.
Dustin: I know that sounds insane, but the Russians have infiltrated Hawkins! The goddamn Russians! And now- they're using- to open the gate.
Mike: Dustin, you're- you're breaking up.
Dustin: And now they're after us and we don't have a way out of here, so I need you to come and get us. Can Nancy drive?
[garbled radio audio]
Mike: Dustin, you're cutting out.
Dustin: Mike?
Mike: Dustin, you there?
Dustin: Mike? Mike, do you copy?
Mike: Dustin-
[powering down noise]
Dustin: Shit! Not now. Please, not now. Mike!
Mike: Dustin!
Dustin: Mike!
[static hissing]
Nancy: [runs over with Jonathan] What is it?
Dustin: Do you have any batteries? Double-A?
Erica: Why would I have batteries?
Dustin: I always carry batteries.
Erica: Then what's the problem?
Dustin: I need eight.
Erica: Eight?
Dustin: Shit. Guess we'll have to go to plan B.
Erica: Plan B? What's plan B?
[film score crescendos]
Dustin: Where... are they?
Steve: [drinking water from a water fountain] That's amazing.
Robin: So, like, I wasn't totally focused in there or anything, but... I'm pretty sure... that mom was trying to bang her son.
Steve: Wait, wait, the hot chick was Alex P. Keaton's mom?
Robin: Yeah, I'm pretty sure.
Steve: But they're the same age.
Robin: No, but he went back in time.
Steve: [snickers] Then why is it called Back to the Future?
Robin: He has to go back to the future because he's in the past. So, the future is actually the present, which is his time.
Steve: Wh... What?
[Robin pushes Steve away from the water fountain]
Robin: No, no, it's my turn. You've had enough. [grunts contentedly]
[gentle synth music playing]
Steve: [looks up at the ceiling] [echoing] Wow.
[twinkling]
Steve: [echoing] Hey, Robin. You gotta check this out.
[Robin grunts as she looks up]
Steve: Check this... This... The ceiling, it's beautiful.
Robin: [echoing] Oh, wow. [chuckles] Oh. [chuckles] [grunts from spinning]
[Steve grunts]
[Steve groans]
[synth music distorts]
[twinkling]
[Steve grunts]
[they run into separate cubicles and hug the porcelain throne]
[Robin coughs]
[Robin retches and spits]
[cheering]
[carnival music playing]
[Hopper parks and Joyce gets out with him]
[Murray goes to get out]
Hopper: [yells] Stay here, go over the plans with Smirnoff.
Murray: I can help look.
Hopper: No, you'll scare the children.
Murray: Jim, if this is about earlier-
Hopper: Stay put, Freud! You hear me? Stay put!
[Murray sighs]
[kids screaming and laughing]
Joyce: Who, Larry?
Hopper: No, Murray. He's a sick individual who likes to get under people's skin. So, let's not let him, you know, get under our skin.
Joyce: I'm not, I haven't.
Hopper: I just, you seem a little more quiet than usual.
Joyce: I just- I just wanna find the kids.
Hopper: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Kline: I'll give it my best shot.
[bell clanging]
[Larry exclaims]
Man: You won yourself a bear!
Kline: Thank you. Here you go. [chuckles and hands it to one of the girls following him]
Photographer: Mayor Kline! One more, one more. Big smile. There we go.
[cheering]
[Kline runs through the fair to his car after seeing Joyce and Hopper]
[he bumps into someone]
Kline: Watch it!
Man 2: Happy Fourth, dick.
[Kline panting]
[dialing on car phone]
[line ringing]
Kline: Come on, come on, come on! Pick up, pick up, pick up, you commie bastards!
[ominous synth music playing]
[freezer humming as El uses her powers]
[pull-tab clicks loudly as Lucas opens a can of Coke]
Max: [whispers] Quiet.
Lucas: [whispers] Oh, sorry.
Mike: How do you even drink that?
Lucas: Because it's delicious.
Mike and Max: What?
Lucas: It's like Carpenter's The Thing. The original is a classic, no question about it. But the remake... [slurping loudly] [satisfied sigh] [smacking lips] Sweeter, bolder... better.
Mike: You're insane.
Lucas: So, you prefer the original Thing?
Mike: What? No, I'm not talking about The Thing, I'm talking about New Coke.
Lucas: It's the same concept, dude.
Mike: Uh, actually, it's not the same concept.
Lucas: It is the same concept.
Mike: No, it's not.
Lucas: [yells] Yes, it is.
Eleven: Hey.
Mike: Sorry.
Lucas: Sorry.
Mike: Did you... find him?
[they grab supplies from around the store]
Lucas: The movies? Dustin's so freaked out about the gate, he decides to go watch a movie? Yeah, makes total sense.
Max: You're positive he said "gate" and not "great"?
Eleven: Sounded like "gate."
Mike: Which would explain how the Mind Flayer's still alive.
Nancy: Yeah, we just have to shut it again.
Will: Then the monster dies.
Max: But if not, we always have Lucas' fireworks.
Lucas: Keep mocking my plan, Max. Keep mocking it. I wanna hear you say it again, because you keep doubting me. You keep doubting me!
Max: Ridiculous.
Lucas: Will?
Will: We're gonna prove 'em wrong, right?
[eerie synth music playing]
[screeching as some of Eleven's blood starts to congeal to form an ooze]
[Steve groans and flushes the toilet]
Robin: The ceiling stopped spinning for me. Is it still spinning for you?
Steve: Holy shit. No. You think we puked it all up?
Robin: Maybe. Ask me something. [in Russian accent] Interrogate me.
Steve: Okay. Interrogate you. Sure. Um... When was the last time you, uh, peed your pants?
Robin: Today.
Steve: What?
Robin: When the Russian doctor took out the bone saw.
Steve: [laughs] Oh, my God.
Robin: It was just a little bit, though.
Steve: Yeah, it's definitely still in her system.
[Robin laughs]
[Steve groans]
Robin: Oh... All right, my turn.
Steve: Okay. Hit me.
Robin: Have you... ever been in love?
Steve: Yep. Nancy Wheeler. First semester, senior year. [imitates gunshot, chuckles]
Robin: Oh, my God. She's such a priss.
Steve: Hm. Turns out, not really.
Robin: [scoffs] Are you still in love with Nancy?
Steve: No.
Robin: Why not?
Steve: I think it's because I found someone who's a little bit better for me. [chuckles] It's crazy. Ever since Dustin got home, he's been saying, "You know, you gotta find your Suzie. You gotta find your Suzie."
Robin: Wait, who's Suzie?
Steve: It's some girl from camp, I guess his girlfriend. To be honest with you, I'm not 100% sure she's even real. But that's not- that's not really the point. That doesn't matter. The point is, this girl, you know, the one that I like, it's somebody that I... didn't even talk to in school. And I don't even know why. Maybe 'cause Tommy H. would've made fun of me or... I wouldn't be... prom king. It's stupid. I mean, Dustin's right, it's all just a bunch of bullshit anyways. Because, when I think about it, I should've been hanging out with this girl the whole time. First of all, she's hilarious. She's so funny. I feel like, this summer, I have laughed harder than I have laughed... in a really long time. And she's smart. Way smarter than me. You know, she can crack, like, top secret Russian codes and... You know? She's honestly unlike anyone I've ever even met before. Robin? [tapping on stall] Robin, did you just OD in there?
Robin: No. [sighs] I... am still alive. [deep sigh]
[Steve slides under the stall to hers]
Robin: The floor's disgusting.
Steve: Yeah, well, I already got a bunch of blood and puke on my shirt, so... What do you think?
Robin: About?
Steve: This girl.
Robin: She sounds awesome.
Steve: She is awesome. And what about the guy?
Robin: I think he's on drugs, and he's not thinking straight.
Steve: Really? 'Cause I think he's thinking a lot more clearly than usual.
Robin: He's not. Look... he doesn't even know this girl. And if he did know her, like- like really know her, I don't think he'd even want to be her friend.
Steve; No, that's not true. No way is that true.
Robin: Listen to me, Steve. It's shocked me to my core, but I like you.
Steve: I really like you.
Steve: Robin, that's exactly why I like you.
Robin: [scoffs] Do you remember what I said about Click's class? About me being jealous and, like, obsessed?
Steve: Yeah.
Robin: It isn't because I had a crush on you. It's because... she wouldn't stop staring at you.
Steve: Mrs. Click?
Robin: [chuckles] Tammy Thompson. I wanted her to look at me. But... she couldn't pull her eyes away from you and your stupid hair. And I didn't understand, because you would get bagel crumbs all over the floor. And you asked dumb questions. And you were a douchebag. And- And you didn't even like her and... I would go home... and just scream into my pillow.
Steve: But Tammy Thompson's a girl.
Robin: [softly] Steve.
Steve: Yeah? [cogs turn] [softly] Oh.
Robin: Oh.
Steve: Holy shit.
Robin: Yeah. Holy shit. Steve... did you OD over there?
Steve: No, I just, uh... just thinking.
Robin: Okay.
Steve: I mean, yeah. Tammy Thompson, you know, she's cute and all, but... I mean, she's a total dud.
Robin: She is not.
Steve: Yes, she is. She wants to be, like, a singer. She wants to move to, like, Nashville and shit.
Robin: She has dreams.
Steve: She can't even hold a tune. She's practically tone-deaf. Have you heard her?
[Robin chuckles]
Steve: All the time. [singing atonally] ♪ You see me now tonight ♪
Robin: Shut up.
Steve: ♪ You see me... ♪
Robin: She does not sound like that.
Steve: She sounds exactly- That's a great impersonation of her.
Robin: She does not. You sound like a Muppet.
Steve: She sounds like a Muppet. She sounds like a Muppet giving birth.
[both laughing]
Steve: [sings like Kermit] ♪ And if you could hold me tight ♪
Steve and Robin: [sing atonally] ♪ We'll be holding on forever ♪
Steve: Exactly.
Robin: [laughs] I know!
[they laugh as Dustin and Erica come into the bathroom]
Dustin: Okay. What the hell?
[both laugh]
[intense synth music playing]
[Billy walks into the store]
[he looks around until he finds the ooze]
[creature shrieks weakly]
[he kneels and puts his fingers in it to get a closer look at it]
[monstrous screeching as Billy's eyes dilate]
[cheering and laughing]
Alexei: [in Russian] And why all this? If I just turn the keys, it's like turning off a car. But then the car still works, does it not?
Murray: [in Russian] Yes.
Alexei: [in Russian] And do you want the car to still work or do you want it to explode?
Murray: [in Russian] I want the car to explode.
Alexei: [in Russian] Good. Then do this. Just make sure you are nowhere near it when it does. It is not pretty. Turns people into dust. And then...
Murray: [in Russian] It's over. [chuckles]
Alexei: [in Russian] And I become an American citizen and join in the fun, yes?
Murray: [in Russian] Who said you had to be an American to join the fun?
[carnival music playing]
[crowd cheering]
[Murray takes Alexei around the fair]
Murray: [in Russian] It doesn't get more American than this, my friend. Fatty foods, ugly decadence, rigged games... [in English] Fifteen tickets, please.
[cheering]
Alexei: [in Russian] They are rigged, these games?
Murray: [in Russian] Yes.
[balloon pops]
Alexei: [in Russian] They do not look rigged.
Murray: [in Russian] That's just it, my dear Alexei. They have been designed to present the illusion of fairness! But it's all a scam, a trick, to put your money in the rich man's pocket. That, my dear friend, is... America. But, hey... knock yourself out.
[carnival barker yelling]
[Murray starts walking away from Alexei which is somehow a smart idea: leaving a Russian man in the middle of an American fair when he can't speak a lick of English]
Alexei: [in Russian] Where are you going?
Murray: [in Russian] To get us the closest thing to food I can find.
[Alexei smiles like a happy child with his tickets and walks off to find a game to play on his own, just missing Joyce and Hopper]
Joyce: Hey. Hey. Karen.
[Joyce and Hopper go over to the ride where Karen is]
Carnival barker: Step right up!
Ted: Hold on. Do we have seat belts?
Joyce: Hey, Karen.
Karen: Joyce! Oh, my gosh! How funny to see you here!
Joyce: Where are the kids?
Ride operator: You three, up against the wall!
Hopper: No, where are they?
Karen: Oh, my gosh, I can hardly keep track these days. Uh, they were at, uh... Dustin's, then Lucas's, then Max's-
Hopper: Max...
Karen: You know how it is. Summer!
[alarm blaring]
Ted: Probably getting into some kinda trouble.
[ride door whirring]
Ride operator: Last warning, you two. Up against the wall!
Hopper: Hold the ride!
Ride operator: On your life, Magnum.
[all exclaiming as the ride begins and they're forced against the wall by the velocity]
[Ted murmurs, probably thinking to himself 'I'm too old for this and I will never take Karen to this place again' as he clings to Holly's teddy]
Karen: Woo! Here we go!
Ted: Holy smokes! Holy smokes!
[rapid carnival music playing]
[Hopper and Joyce look at each other and hold hands, not enjoying the ride]
Doc: Roads? Where we're going, we don't need roads.
[cheering] 
[indistinct chatter]
[door hinge creaking]
Dustin: And... blend.
Woman: It is so good!
[Dustin, Erica, Steve and Robin wander with the movie-goers, definitely not conspicuous at all]
Erica: Well, shit, that worked.
Dustin: Course it worked. We just have to get on the bus with the rest of these plebes, and home sweet home, here we come.
Steve: Uh, Dustin?
Dustin: What?
Steve: Yeah, we might not wanna go to your house.
Dustin: Why?
Steve: Well, I might've told them your full name.
Dustin: What is wrong with you?
Steve: Dude, I was drugged.
Dustin: So?
Steve: So?
Dustin: So, you resist. You tough it out. You tough it out like a man.
Steve: Oh, yeah, it's easy for you to say.
Robin: Guys?
[she stops everyone and they look at the doors, seeing people checking shoppers as they exit]
Guard: Sorry for the inconvenience. Have a pleasant evening.
Dustin: Abort.
[the guard glances over, suspenseful music playing]
Dustin: Abort. Abort.
[they run away, panting]
Steve: Shit.
[they see the escalator is closed]
Robin: Okay.
Steve: Come on, let's go, let's go.
[they all slide down to the lower level]
[onlookers cheering]
Man: That's three green! And here's dart number four!
[carnival music playing]
[cheering]
Man: One more for the big prize!
Kid: You can do it, mister!
[bell ringing as Alexei pops his final green balloon]
[loud cheering]
Man: We have a winner!
[Alexei walks proudly with a Woody Woodpecker stuffed toy to find Murray]
Barker: Step right up, ladies and gentlemen! Get your tickets right here!
Alexei: [in Russian] Murray! Look! It's not rigged!
Murray: Ah! [laughs like Woody Woodpecker]
Alexei: [in Russian] It's not rigged. 
[Murray laughs heartily]
[ominous music playing]
[carnival audio fades as Grigori enters the chat]
[silenced gunshot]
Grigori: [in Russian] Traitor. [walks away]
[Alexei drops the toy, revealing the gunshot wound in his stomach]
Murray: [faintly] Alexei!
[he runs over, feedback whining]
[Alexei looks at the blood on his hands from the wound]
[clown's laughter echoing in slow motion]
Murray: [resuming normal volume] Alexei!
[carnival audio resumes]
Murray: [in English] Oh, no. Oh, my God. Let's go.
[Alexei grunts and coughs as Murray leads him to a space between booths so he can rest]
Murray: Easy.
[Alexei groans and sits]
Murray: [in Russian] Keep pressure on it. I'll get you help. I'll get help.
[suspenseful synth music playing]
[Murray runs around, trying to find Joyce and Hopper]
[indistinct chatter]
[crowd cheering]
Murray: Jim... Jim. Jim! They got Alexei, Jim! Jim! Alexei! They got Alexei, Jim!
Hopper: [exhales sharply, sees Grigori approaching] We gotta go. We gotta go.
Joyce: What?
[they start running]
Hopper: Let's go.
Karen: They make an odd couple, don't they?
Ted: [puts his hand on Karen's shoulder, making everyone realise that he's actually pretty tall because he's always sat down and we as viewers never knew this information before] Well, it's like they say, there's someone for everyone.
[carnival music playing]
[bell ringing]
[Karen sighs deeply, maybe wondering if he's thinking about them being a mismatched couple at all because he's so tall and she's average-sized]
[suspenseful music playing]
[crowd exclaims]
Male vendor: Who wants a hot dog?
Hopper: Find Murray, get the car, bring it around back.
Joyce: Okay.
[Hopper runs towards the Big Top, a recording of cackling laughter playing]
Vasilev: [in Russian] Heading to "Big Top." Northeast side of the fair.
Carnival barker: Step right up, ladies and gentlemen! Get your tickets to the Big Top here! [speaking indistinctly] ...this side of the Mississippi.
Hopper: [running through the Big Top] Hey! Get your kids outta here! Police! Get 'em out of here! Go!
Barker: You, sir! Step on up! I see you eyeing the maze! Don't be surprised! Don't be scared!
[crowd cheering]
Barker: Step on up, sir!
[recording of cackling laughter]
Eerie male voice: Do you dare enter the cave of horrors? You never know what you might find around the corner.
[recording of eerie giggling as Vasilev sneaks through the room of hanging punching-bag-esque things, trying to find Hopper even though he doesn't look around the ground for feet]
Recording: Don't show your fear in the presence of the tiger.
[tiger's roar sounds]
Recording: Or you may never escape this cave alive.
[tiger's roar sounds]
[Hopper yells as he pushes one of the hanging bags into Vasilev]
[fighting grunts as our favorite cop rushes the Russian into the wall]
[Joyce runs around, looking for Murray]
[she gasps]
[she screams when Murray suddenly grabs her, panting]
[they run to where Murray left Alexei]
Joyce: Alexei! Oh, my God.
[she tries to wake him up but it's too late, Alexei has left the chat]
Murray: I... I just left for a minute... for a corn dog.
[Joyce cries]
Murray: A stupid corn dog.
Joyce: Oh, God. Oh, no.
[Vasilev grunts as Hopper punches him]
[carnival music playing]
[fighting grunts as Vasilev tries to kick Hopper but Hopper grabs his leg and forces him back]
[Vasilev groans after Hopper punches him so hard, he flips over backwards]
[Hopper yells as he picks up Vasilev and throws him]
[Hopper grunts as he finally gets punched by Vasilev]
[Vasilev quickly realises he's awoken the bear when Hopper headbutts him, Vasilev wailing in pain]
[Vasilev groans as Hopper throws him, once again, into the cheap metal walls]
[Hopper yells as he picks up one of the punching bag things and throws it onto Vasilev]
[intense synth music playing as Grigori enters the Big Top]
[indistinct chatter]
[Hopper panting as he grabs Vasilev's gun]
[indistinct male voice on radio]
Man: [on radio, in Russian] Vasilev, are you there? Vasilev? Answer!
[male voice continues in Russian]
[tiger's roar sounds as Hopper picks up the radio and walks through the tiger's mouth]
[Grigori enters the room, hearing recording of cackling laughter]
[he spots his comrade on the ground and continues on]
[carnival music playing]
[Joyce spots Kline by a motorbike and stops]
Murray: What are you doing?
Joyce: [walks over to Kline] Hey! Larry.
Kline: Joyce.
[Joyce grunts as she, a 5'3'' woman, punches Kline, a 6' tall man, in the jaw]
[Larry wails in pain, both his pride and jaw hurting immensely]
[Joyce then moves him quickly so he;s upright before kicking him without remorse in the nuts]
Kline: Ooh! [groans]
Man: Yeah, lady!
[Joyce walks away, still angry at Kline but happy that he will rue the day he crossed her]
[suspenseful synth music playing as Grigori enters the hall of mirrors]
[silenced gunshots as Grigori fires at a reflection of Hopper, wasting his bullets like a stupid child who was even more stupidly given a gun]
Hopper: Hey.
[Hopper cleverly uses his bullets to shoot Grigori and not his reflection, hearing silenced gunshots]
[men start following Hopper, speaking Russian]
[Hopper gasps, realising he must flee if he wishes to see Joyce again]
[recording of cackling laughter]
[Grigori gasps for air, groans, not dead]
[Grigori coughs and reveals his bulletproof vest under his shirt which he unceremoniously rips open]
Man: [in Russian] Comrade!
Grigori: [in Russian] Get off me!
[Hopper runs through the Big Top, the recording of cackling laughter in the background]
[he gets to a slide and looks back, Grigori stumbling out of the mirror room]
[Hopper sighs, no one told him he'd be fighting the Terminator today and he's a little miffed]
[he goes down the slide, not enjoying it]
Hopper: Goddamn! Son of a bitch!
[he gets out, grunting, and runs off]
[he groans and grunts as he runs out the back of the ride]
Hopper: Hey!
[Joyce pulls over and Hopper climbs into the backseat]
Hopper: Hit it. Hit it! Go! Go! 
[Hopper quickly realises someone's missing from their four-person party as Joyce drives off and he takes up all of the back seat]
Hopper: Alexei?
[Murray gives him a look and Hopper sighs, knowing Alexei left the chat]
Man on radio: [in Russian] On the lower level-
Hopper: [passes Murray the radio] Hey, translate.
Radio: [in Russian] We've found the children. They are still in the mall. Lower level.
Man: [in Russian] Keep all entrances locked down. I repeat- Keep all entrances locked down.
[squeaking sound comes from behind a store counter]
Man: [quietly, in Russian] Everyone, get over here. I found them.
[kids panting behind the counter]
[the Russians advance on thr counter, the kids panting]
[car alarm suddenly starts wailing]
[all gasping]
[horn honking]
Man: [in Russian] What the hell?
[intense synth music playing as they look up]
[Eleven has entered the chat]
[she throws the car at them, the men groaning]
[Dustin, Robin, Erica and Steve pop out from behind the counter, steam hissing]
[a single metal hubcab is the only thing moving, clattering]
[dramatic synth music playing as they, like the Russians, look up and see Eleven]
[they all run to meet one another, except Eleven who is helped hobble by Mike]
Dustin: [laughing] You flung that thing like a Hot Wheel!
[Dustin grunts as he hugs Mike and Eleven]
Erica: Lucas?
Lucas: What are you doing here?
Erica: Ask them. It's their fault.
Steve: True, yeah. Totally true. It's absolutely our fault.
Robin: I don't understand what happened to that car.
Dustin: El has superpowers.
Robin: I'm sorry?
Steve: Superpowers. She threw it with her mind. C'mon, catch up.
Erica: That's El?
Robin: Who's El?
Nancy: I'm sorry, who are you?
Robin: I'm Robin. I work with Steve.
Dustin: She cracked the top secret code.
Steve: Yeah, which is how we found out about the Russians in the first place.
Jonathan: Russians? Wait, what Russians?
Steve: The Russians!
Max: Those were Russians?
Erica: Some of them.
Lucas: What are you talking about?
Dustin: Didn't you hear our code red?
Mike: Yeah. Couldn't understand what you were saying.
Dustin: Goddamn low battery.
Steve: [Mom mode engaged] How many times do I have to tell you with the low battery?
Dustin: Well, everything worked out, didn't it?
Erica: Worked out? We almost died.
Dustin: Yeah, but we didn't, did we?
Steve: It was pretty damn close.
Lucas: Okay, Russians? As in, they're working for the Russian government? 
[Eleven panting, looking back at them]
Dustin: What are you not comprehending? Am I not speaking English? We have a full-blown Red Dawn situation.
[droning sound]
Max: So this has nothing to do with the gate?
Dustin:  It has everything to do with the gate...
[droning sound intensifies, Eleven is clearly the only one who hears it]
[Eleven grunts and groans as she hits the floor]
Steve: Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Mike: El! El!
[Eleven whimpering]
Erica: What's wrong with her?
Mike: What's wrong? What's wrong? What's wrong?
Eleven: My leg. My leg.
Jonathan: Her leg, her leg. Okay.
[Eleven panting as they take off the bandage]
Jonathan: Get that off.
Nancy: Okay.
[all exclaim in disgust, Jonathan backing backpedalling as fast as he can]
[Erica groans]
[Mike gasps and Max looks at the camera]
[intense synth music playing as something in Eleven's leg moves]
[Eleven grunting and wailing]
Mike: El! El!
Eleven: [wailing]
Mike: El! El, are you okay? 
[she's clearly not okay]
Mike: El! El! El!
[Eleven screaming]
