["Angel" playing]
Max: [singing along] â™ª You must be an angel, I can see it in your eyes, Full of wonder and surprise...  [chuckles] Oh, you found Ralph Macchio.
Eleven: Macchio?
Max: Yeah, he's the Karate Kid. Hai-yah! [laughs] He's so hot, right? I bet he's an amazing kisser, too. Hey, uh... is Mike a good kisser?
Eleven: I don't know. He's my first boyfriend.
Max: Ex-boyfriend. Hey, don't worry about it. Okay? He'll come crawling back to you in no time, begging for forgiveness. I guarantee you, him and Lucas are, like, totally wallowing in self-pity and misery right now. They're like, "Oh, I hope they take us back."
[both laughing]
Max: God, what I wouldn't give to see their stupid faces. What is it?
[they set up the radio and Eleven blindfolds herself]
[radio static crackling]
Max: Is this really gonna work? Holy shit, this is insane.
Eleven: Max.
Max: Yeah, quiet. I'm sorry.
[distorted voices]
[Mike is lying on a couch, Lucas is pacing and Will is setting something up on a table]
Mike: What's wrong with me? What did I do wrong?
Lucas: Nothing.
[static stops]
Mike: What did I do wrong? What could I have done wrong?
Lucas: Do I have to go through this again?
Eleven: I see them.
Max: What are they doing?
Eleven: Eating.
[crunching echoes]
Mike: I just don't understand what I did to deserve this.
Lucas: Nothing. Nothing. That's my whole point. You are the victim here.
Mike: I know. It's just, why is she treating me this way?
Will: I don't know.
Lucas: Mike-
Mike: What did I do wrong? What did I do wrong?!
Lucas: Mike, stop. Relax. Just relax. Okay? Stop asking rational questions.
Mike: I know, I know, you're right.
Lucas: Yeah.
Mike: Because women act on emotion and not logic.
Lucas: Precisely. It's a totally different species.
Eleven: They say we are "species."
Max: What?
Eleven: "Emotion, not logic."
Max: What? [looks like she'll definitely punch one of the boys when she sees them next]
Will: Guys, it's ready.
Lucas: Will, not right now.
Will: They broke up with you. What else is there to talk about?
Lucas: Tons.
Mike: Yeah, we're trying to solve the great mystery of the female species.
[echoing belch]
Mike: [chuckles] Dude, you can smell the nacho cheese.
[Will groans, disgusted by his misogynistic, gross friends]
Lucas: I got that beat.
Mike: What?
Will: Oh, no. [this is what he's been dreading the last few seconds] No, Lucas, no.
[Lucas lifts up his leg and farts]
Mike: No! Lucas! Lucas!
[farting loudly]
[fart echoes]
[Eleven pulls off the blindfold]
Max: What happened?
[Eleven giggles]
Max: What... What? What happened?
[Eleven laughs]
[both laugh]
[car approaches outside]
[Hopper grunts when he sees Eleven's door closed]
[pop music playing]
Hopper: [who somehow drove home drunk WHICH YOU SHOULD NOT DO] Hey! Hey! When I say three inches, three-
Max: Do you knock? Jeez!
Eleven: Yeah! Jeez!
Hopper: Oh, hey. I'm sorry. I thought that, uh-
Max: Mike's not here.
Eleven: Max wanted to have... a sleepover. Is that... okay?
Hopper: Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Your parents know about it?
Max: Yup.
Hopper: [slurring] Uh, yeah, it's cool. Yeah. That's- That's really cool.
[he stands there for a minute because he is trying to process everything while drunk]
Max: Did you need something?
Hopper: No, no. Uh, I'll leave. I'll just let you... I'll leave you... 
["Lovergirl" playing]
[contented grunt from Hopper as he pours himself a glass of wine, kicks off his shoes and puts on the TV]
[the girls set up a spin-the-bottle-esque board on El's bed with Mr. Clarke, Nancy, Dustin, Steve, Billy and Mr. and Mrs. Wheeler on it]
Max: Holy shit, I can't believe we're really doing this. Ready?
Eleven: Ready. [she spins the bottle]
Both: Mr. Wheeler.
Max: Ugh. Boring.
Eleven: Yeah, boring.
Max: Spin again.
Eleven: Against the rules?
Max: We make our own rules.
[both chuckle]
[Eleven spins the Cola bottle again]
Both: Billy.
Max: Okay, look, I should just warn you, if he's with a girl or doing something gross, just get out of there right away before you're scarred for life. [grabs the radio and blindfold]
Eleven: Max-
Max; No, I'm just saying, I'm serious. He's really gross.
Eleven: Max!
Max: Okay, shutting up now.
[tuning radio]
[radio static crackling]
[static stops]
[car engine idling]
[soft whimper]
[Heather whimpering]
[pained whimpering]
Eleven: I found him.
Max: What's he doing?
Eleven: I don't know.
Billy: Don't be afraid.
Eleven: He's... on the floor...
Billy: It'll be over soon.
Eleven: ...talking to someone.
[Heather whimpering]
Billy: Just stay very still.
[Heather whimpering and gasping]
Heather: [screaming] Billy!
[Billy turns and looks at Eleven, scaring her]
[screaming]
[sharp exhale]
[gasps]
Max: What is it? What happened?
[Ted mows the lawn outside in the rain]
[rolling thunder]
[loud medieval music playing]
Mike: Yes! [groans as he and Lucas wake up]
Lucas: What are you doing?
Mike: Yeah, Will, can you turn down the music?
Will: Please address me by my full name.
Mike: What?
Will: My full name!
Mike: Oh, my God. Okay, Will the Wise, can you please turn down the music?
Will: That is not music. That... is the sound of destiny! I have seen into the future, and I've seen that today is a new day, a day... free of girls!
Lucas: What is happening right now?
Mike: Will, come on.
Will: A tribe of villagers are under threat from an evil force from the swamps of Kuzatan.
Mike: Will, it's so early.
Will: Is it? Is it early, Michael? Tell that to the villagers crying for your help, the children so frightened, they cannot sleep. Are you truly going to let them perish? Or are you going to come to their rescue and become the heroes you were always meant to be?
Lucas: Uh... Can I at least take a shower first?
[Hopper groans in the shower, gurgling the water]
Hopper: Oh, God. [groans and grabs some pills to cure his hangover] [grunts] [slurps up some milk and burps] [grunts when he sees Eleven's note 'Gone to Max's sleeping over - El']
[knocking]
Joyce: Hopper? Are you there?
[he opens the door, still in his towel]
Hopper: Oh! Look who it is!
[Joyce walks in]
Joyce: We need to talk.
Hopper: Yeah, we do. I haven't been stood up like that since Alice Gilbert in the 9th grade. What are you doing? Joyce. Hello?
Joyce: Just watch.
[she pours some fridge magnets out of her bag onto the floor]
Hopper: Okay, you're freaking me out. [he puts on a shirt, even though he hasn't dried off... he may still be drunk]
Joyce: You slipped on this, remember?
Hopper: Yeah. 
Joyce: Yeah, it fell in the night. It lost its magnetism.
Hopper: Oh, did it?
Joyce: And the same exact thing happened at my house the day before.
Hopper: Wow.
Joyce: And I thought, "Okay, that's weird." Right? Why are all these magnets suddenly losing their magnetism?
Hopper: Uh-huh?
Joyce: So, I went and saw Scott.
Hopper: Scott. Who's Scott?
Joyce: Scott Clarke.
Hopper: Your child's science teacher?
Hopper: He's pretty brilliant, actually. And I asked him, "How is this happening?" And he built this magnetic field using an AC transformer and plugging it into a solenoid. And- And with that solenoid, which basically-
Hopper: Slow down, slow down. I just want to get this exactly right, okay? You stand me up...
[Joyce sighs]
Hopper: ...no phone call, no apology, because you had to go to Scott Clarke's house.
Joyce: Yeah.
Hopper: [scoffs] [chuckles] You've outdone yourself, Joyce. You really have. No, you've outdone yourself.
Joyce: Oh, come on, Hop, you're not even listening to me. Scott was able to demagnetize some of the magnets, and he thinks-
Hopper: I don't care what Scott thinks!
Joyce: He thinks that a large-scale magnetic field could be built using some sort of machine or- or experimental technology.
Hopper: He's brilliant, isn't he? He's really brilliant. Is he single too?
Joyce: [scoffs] What if it's them? To build a machine like this, you need resources. You need scientists, you need funding, tens of millions of dollars.
Hopper: Joyce.
Joyce: It can't just be a coincidence, Hopper. It has to be them.
Hopper: Joyce, stop.
Joyce: It has to be the lab.
Hopper: It is impossible.
Joyce: Well, then, prove it to me.
Hopper: Prove it?
Joyce: Yeah, take me back there.
Hopper: To the lab.
Joyce: Yeah, I wanna go back.
Hopper: Because some magnets fell off your fridge.
Joyce: Yes.
Hopper: Okay, makes sense.
Joyce: [scoffs] Thank you.
Hopper: It makes sense. I'm sorry. I'm a little busy right now, but maybe we can meet up there, like tonight, like seven o'clock? You know, of course, unless something comes up which, you know, it will.
Joyce: You know, after everything that's happened, this is no joke.
[Hopper goes into his room and closes the curtain to get dressed]
Hopper: No, I don't think it's a joke. I think that when I asked you out, I think you got scared. I think you got scared, and now, you're inventing things. You're inventing things to get worked up about so that you can push me away. Because God forbid any of us move on! Because that... that would be... [chuckles] I mean, that would be too much, right, Joyce? You know? That would be too much, wouldn't it, Joyce? Wouldn't it, Joyce?
[he opens the curtain, Joyce is gone]
[distant crow squawks]
Hopper: Joyce? Joyce! 
[Joyce bursts out of his shed with bolt cutters and a flashlight]
Hopper: What the hell are you doing?
Joyce: I need to borrow these.
Hopper: [putting on shoes] No, you're not going back there. Joyce... Joyce, you're not going back there...
[car door opens]
Hopper: [hopping along, putting his shoe on] Son of a bitch!
[Eleven and Max walk over to it]
[thunder rumbling]
Max: It's gonna start pouring soon. We should be at the mall or, like, watching a movie or something.
Eleven: You don't believe me? 
Max: I believe you saw some super weird stuff, totally, but you said Mike has sensed you in there before, right? So maybe it was just like that. Maybe Billy just... sensed you somehow.
Eleven: But the screams.
Max: Yeah, I know, but here's the thing. When Billy is alone with a girl, they make, like, really crazy noises.
Eleven: They scream?
Max: Yeah, but, like... happy screams.
Eleven: Happy screams? What is happy screams?
Max: It's like... I'm just gonna lend you my mom's Cosmo. His car's not here. You really want to do this?
[they go into Billy's room]
Max: Why do I get the feeling we're gonna find all kinds of wrong in here?
[heavy metal playing on stereo]
Max: [she opens a drawer and finds adult magazines] Ugh! Gag me with a spoon.
[they go into the bathroom, the door creaking]
[Eleven sees the now empty ice packets in the bath]
Eleven: Max?
Max: Ice. It's just ice. Probably for his muscles or something. He works out like a maniac
[Eleven sees the blood on the cabinet, her breath trembling]
[she opens the cabinet and gets out the bin
Max: El, what is it?
[El takes out the lifeguard bumbag that is definitely not Billy's style and a bloody whistle, breath trembling]
Jonathan: You sure about this?
Nancy: [chuckles] You really are your mother's son, you know that?
Jonathan: What's that supposed to mean?
Nancy: It means... you worry too much.
Jonathan: Huh.
Nancy: I got this, okay?
Jonathan: Okay.
Tom: So, what exactly are we looking at here? Is this the Driscoll lady's stuff?
Nancy: No. No, see, that's the thing. I mean, listen, I thought she was crazy too, but-
Editor: She told me Johnson killed Kennedy.
[men laugh]
Nancy: But, it turns out, she's not alone. Blackburn's Supply, Hawkins Farming, the Crawleys, they've all had some supplies go missing, all in the past few days. And it's not just fertilizer. It's pesticides, cleaning supplies, diesel fuel. And that's just from one day of calling around. I mean... there's gotta be more.
Bruce: Okay, wait, wait, wait. Let me get this little... story of yours straight. So, little rodents have gone cuckoo in their furry little minds and they're running around the town of Hawkins, dining out on chemicals.
Nancy: I know how it sounds, but-
Bruce: But you've got proof!
[men laugh]
Bruce: I mean, fellas, you gotta admit, it's a hell of a headline, right? "Hawkins Rodents Prefer Poison: Nutjob Tells All."
Tom: Guys, that's enough.
[laughter stops]
Tom: I think this is... big. Bigger than one article. In fact, I think this has got to be a book. The Mysterious Case of the Missing Fertilizer, a Nancy Drew mystery.
[men laugh]
Tom: Next time a call comes in, do what you were hired for, and let us know, yeah?
Nancy: Ah...
Tom: We'll decide what's a story and what's not. 
Nancy: Okay.
[men laugh as she leaves]
Bruce: Bye-bye, Nancy Drew.
Jonathan: Hey, it's okay. Nancy. Nancy!
[bell dinging]
[man speaking Russian on Robin's headphones]
Erica: Excuse me. Ahoy!
[Robin sighs]
[nautical tune playing]
Erica: I'd like to try the peanut butter chocolate swirl, please.
Robin: No. No more samples today.
Erica: Why not?
Robin: Because you're abusing our company policy.
Erica: Where's the sailor man?
Robin: Sorry, he can't help you. He's busy.
Erica: Busy with what?
Robin: Spycraft.
["Things Can Only Get Better" playing]
[Steve appears from behind a plant using some binoculars, totally inconspicuous in his sailor-style Scoops Ahoy uniform]
Dustin: You see anything?
Steve: Uh, I guess I don't totally know what I'm looking for.
Dustin: Evil Russians.
Steve: Yeah, exactly. I don't know what an evil Russian looks like.
Dustin: Tall, blond, not smiling.
Steve: Mm-hmm?
Dustin: Also, look for earpieces, camo, duffel bags, that sort of thing.
Steve: Right, okay, duffel bags. Oh, you've gotta be kidding me.
Dustin: What?
Steve: Anna Jacobi's talking with that meathead Mark Lewinsky.
Dustin: If you're not gonna focus, just gimme the binoculars.
Steve: Aw, Jesus Christ, whatever happened to standards? I mean, Lewinsky never even came off the bench.
Dustin: Dude, you are the worst spy in history, you know that?
[Dustin tries to take the binoculars]
Steve: Stop, hey. Stop.
Dustin: Give me those. I don't get why you're looking at girls. You have the perfect one in front of you.
Steve: Seriously, if you say Robin again-
Dustin: Robin.
Steve: No, don't. No.
Dustin: Robin, Robin, Robin.
Steve: Stop, no, no, no.
Dustin: Robin. Robin. Robin.
Steve: No.
Dustin: Robin.
Steve: No! No, man, she's not my type. She's not even... in the ballpark of what my type is, all right?
Dustin: What's your type again? Not awesome?
Steve: Thank you.
Dustin: Hm.
Steve: For your information, she's still in school. And she's weird. She's a weirdo. And she's hyper. I don't like that she's hyper. And she did drama. That's a bad look. 
Dustin: And she's in band?
Steve: No.
Dustin: Now that you're out of high school, which means you're technically an adult, don't you think it's time you move on from primitive constructs such as popularity?
Steve: Oh, primitive constructs? That some stupid shit you learned at Camp... Know... Nothing?
Dustin: Camp Know Where, actually. And no, it's shit I learned from life.
Steve: Hm.
Dustin: Instead of dating somebody you think's gonna make you cooler, why not date somebody you actually enjoy being around? Like me and Suzie.
Steve: Oh, Suzie. Yeah, you mean, "hotter than Phoebe Cates."
Dustin: Yeah, that Suzie.
Steve: And, uh, let's think about how exactly did you score that beautiful girlfriend? Oh, yeah. With my advice. Because that's how this works, Henderson. I give you the advice, you follow through. Not the other way around, all right, pea-brain?
[thunder rumbling]
Will: Do you guys hear that? It sounds like... thunder.
[orchestral march playing]
Will: But, no, wait. That's not thunder. It's... a horde of juju zombies! Sir Mike, your action.
Mike: What should I do?
Lucas: Attack?
Mike: Okay, I attack with my flail. [rolls dice]
Will: Whoosh! You miss. Your flail clanks the stone, the zombie horde lumbers towards you, and... the juju bites your arm. Flesh tears! Aah! Seven points of damage.
Mike: [sarcastically] Oh, no, my arm. Lucas, look, my arm.
[Lucas snickers]
Will: Sir Lucas, the zombie horde roars! Do you fight back or do you run?
[phone ringing]
Will: No! It's a distraction! A trap. Do not answer it.
[Lucas and Mike get up and go to the phone]
Will: What... No!
Mike: El? No. Sorry, not interested. Telemarketers. 
Lucas; Maybe we should just call them.
Mike: We can do that?
Lucas: I think so.
Mike: Yeah, but what would we say?
Will: We'll say nothing! The Khuisar tribe still needs your help. 
Mike: All right, then. I'll use my torch to set fire to the chambers, sacrificing ourselves, killing the jujus, and saving the Khuisar. We all live on as heroes in the memories of the Kalamar.
Lucas Victory.
Will: Okay. Fine. You guys win.
[music stops as Will starts angrily packing away, taking off his robes]
Will: Congratulations.
Mike: Will, I was just messing around. Hey, let's finish for real. How much longer is the campaign?
Will: Just forget it, Mike.
Mike: No, you want to keep playing, right?
Lucas: Y-Yeah, totally.
Mike: We'll just call the girls afterwards.
Will: I said forget it, Mike, okay? I'm going home.
Mike: But...
Lucas: Come on, Will.
Will: Move!
[Will starts going upstairs]
[Lucas sighs before following him with Mike]
Mike: Will, come on. You can't leave. It's raining. Listen, I said I was sorry, all right? It's a cool campaign. It's really cool. We're just not in the mood right now.
Will: Yeah, Mike. That's the problem. You guys are never in the mood anymore. You're ruining our party.
Mike: That's not true.
Will: Really? Where's Dustin right now? See? You don't know and you don't even care. And obviously he doesn't either and I don't blame him. You're destroying everything, and for what? So you can swap spit with some stupid girl?
Mike: El's not stupid. It's not my fault you don't like girls.
[thunder rumbling]
Mike: I'm not trying to be a jerk. Okay? But we're not kids anymore. I mean, what did you think, really? That we were never gonna get girlfriends? We were just gonna sit in my basement all day and play games for the rest of our lives?
Will: Yeah. [sniffles] I guess I did. I really did. [he rides away in the rain without a coat]
Mike: Will. Will! Will, come on!
[indistinct chatter]
[kids laughing and squealing]
[kids squealing]
[thunder rumbling]
Max: Excuse me.
Pool Manager: No one in the water until 30 minutes after the last strike. And don't try and argue with me. You wanna get electrocuted, go climb a tree.
Max: Yeah, we don't care. We're not here to swim. Or get electrocuted.
Eleven: We found this.
Max: Does that belong to anybody here?
Pool Manager: Oh, yeah. That's Heather's. I'll get it back to her.
Eleven: We could give it back to her.
Pool Manager: You could. 'Cept she's not here. Bailed on me today. What is this? You girls want a reward or somethin'?
Max: No. We're just... Good Samaritans.
[they look over at the list of lifeguards and look at the pictures]
Max: Heather. Do you think you can find her?
Lifeguard: No way!
[Pool Manager and Lifeguard chuckling]
[the girls go into the showers]
[Eleven covers a snorkel in duct tape while Max turns on all the showers]
[splashing footsteps]
Max: What do you see?
Eleven: A door. A red door.
[Eleven opens the door, creaking]
[she sees a bathtub full of ice]
[Heather suddenly comes up for air, gasping]
Heather: [echoing] Help me.
[Eleven screams as Heather goes under the water and the bathrub disappears]
[Eleven gasping]
[Heather is dragged under the water floor, screaming]
Heather:  Help me!
[feedback squealing]
Eleven: [muffled] No!
[Eleven takes off her snorkel, gasping]
Max: What happened? El!
[panting]
[Hopper pulls up to the lab and gets he bolt cutters and flashlight]
[they break in and look around]
Hopper: Hello? Anybody home? We come in peace.
[Joyce remembers Bob panting]
[Bob grunts as he's tackled to the floor by a demo-dog]
Joyce: [screaming] No!
[creature growls]
[Bob screams]
Joyce: No!
[Joyce wails]
Hopper: Let's go!
Hopper: Joyce. You okay?
Joyce: I'm fine.
Hopper: You want to wait in the car?
Joyce: I said I'm fine.
[door opens]
[soft beeping as a security camera turns on]
[door closes]
[Dustin is looking through the binoculars]
[distorted laughter]
[indistinct chatter]
[suspenseful music playing]
Dustin: Target acquired.
Steve: Where?
Dustin: Ten o'clock. Sam Goody's.
Steve: Give me that. [grabs the binoculars] Shit. Duffel bag.
Both: Evil Russian.
[they follow the man who looks like a young Arnold Schwarzenegger with long hair and sunglasses up the escalator]
Dustin: Slow down.
Steve: We're losin' him.
Dustin: You're getting too close.
Man: [gets bumped into by Steve] Watch it, dickwad.
Dustin: [picks up a phone as the man turns around] [in monotone voice] Hello. Yes. I am fine. How are you?
[they watch as he walks into jazzercise]
Man: All right, everyone, listen up! [unzipping his bag] I just have one question for you. Who... is ready to sweat? [gets out his boombox]
[women cheering]
Man: That's right! Okay! Let's start it nice and easy now. Let's move our thighs. Yeah!
[cheering]
Man: Yeah, ladies, warm it up.
["Wake Me Up Before You Go-Go" plays]
Man: Bring it down to your hips. Start feeling that burn, everywhere, down in the loins, right? Come on, ladies, show me what you got.
[Steve watches the women jazzercise as if he didn't know this place existed before just now, very happy]
Man: Slow now. Just isolate. Ooh, tip that up. That feels good!
[Dustin looks horrified at the man who is now in a purple tank top and is doing hip tilt stretches]
Robin: "The week is long. The silver cat feeds when blue meets yellow in the west. A trip to China sounds nice if you tread lightly." "Tread lightly"?
[knocking]
[Robin sighs and heads into the back]
[knocking]
Lynx Delivery Man: Delivery for you.
Robin: Thank you.
[pen scratching as she signs]
[Robin notices 'lynx' on the man's uniform]
[suspenseful music playing]
Lynx Delivery Man: Have a nice day.
Robin: Yeah, you too.
[Robin watches the man leave down the tunnels connecting the backs of the stores, seeing the silver lynx logo on the man's uniform]
Robin: Silver cat. Silver cat.
[Steve and Dustin walk into the store]
Steve: You're not gonna believe who Dustin thought was a Russian.
Dustin: You did too.
Steve: No, I did not.
Dustin: Yes, you did.
Steve: No, I did not.
[Robin runs out of the store with her notepad and looks around]
Robin: "A trip to China sounds nice." A trip to China sounds nice. A trip to China sounds nice. A trip to China sounds nice. [spots Imperial Panda] A trip to China sounds nice. [gasps and looks around more] "If you tread lightly." If you tread... If you tread... [looks at Kaufman Shoes and gasps] If you tread lightly. "When- When blue and yellow meet in the west." [she spots the clock with blue and yellow hands] When blue meets yellow... in the west.
Steve: Robin. What are you doing?
Robin: I cracked it.
Steve: Cracked what?
Robin: I cracked the code.
[Nancy is setting up the coffee machine]
[she reaches into the cupboard]
[she gasps, seeing a rubber rat taped to the inside of the cupboard door]
Bruce: Oh-ho-ho! Oh!
[laughter]
Bruce: There it is! Careful! It might have rabies! [chittering]
[men snickering]
Bruce: Better get that thing outta here. You don't want it eatin' the tires off your car.
[Nancy grabs the rat and heads into the dark room]
[Nancy opens the door and walks over]
Jonathan: Come on! What- [catches the rubber rat] What's this?
Nancy: Proof.
Jonathan: Proof?
Nancy: They said they wanted proof, right? So let's give it to 'em.
Jonathan: A rubber rat?
Nancy: No, the real rat. Driscoll's rat. You said yourself it looked sick. We can take it to an animal control center, they can run some blood tests on it, figure out what's wrong with it-
Jonathan: Whoa, Nancy, slow down. Tom didn't ask for proof. He asked us to drop the story.
Nancy: That's because he didn't believe us.
Jonathan: Nancy.
Nancy: I'm right.
Jonathan: That's not the point.
Nancy: Then what's the point?
Jonathan: You should've thought about that before you talked to them. All right? They're assholes, okay? I get it. But it's just some stupid story.
Nancy: Oh, it's stupid?
Jonathan: It's stupid to get fired over.
Nancy: No one's going to fire us. Look, if you don't want to go, that's fine. Just... give me the keys.
Jonathan: You're relentless, you know that? Come on. [grabs his jacket]
[thunderclap]
[Hopper sighs, walking over to where the gate was]
[he grumbles, feeling the wall]
Hopper: Nobody's home. All the cavities have been filled. I watched 'em do it, Joyce.
[Joyce thinks of everything: the gate, finding Will in the Upside Down]
Joyce: Will!
[creature shrieking as it's driven out of Will]
Hopper: It's over. It's over.
Joyce: I feel like I'm losing my mind.
Hopper: You're not losing your mind. Not any more than I am. You know, the other day, I almost shot Betsy Payne's dog because it came rushing at me from behind this fence, and I... I swear to God, I thought it was one of those things. You know that I'm keeping a close eye on things, right?
Joyce: Yeah.
Hopper: Because it's important to me. It is important to me that you feel safe. That you and your family feel safe. I want you to feel like this can still be your home. What? You didn't think I'd find out about that? Gary called me. e said he's fixing up your house to put on the market. [sighs] The kids know yet?
[Joyce sighs]
Hopper: After Sarah... I had to get away. I had to get the hell out of that place, you know? Outrun those, uh... those memories, I guess. [exhales] I mean, why do you think I ended up back in this shithole?
[Joyce chuckles]
Hopper: But you have something that I never had. You have people that know what you've been through. You have people that care about you. Right here. In Hawkins.
Joyce: You mean... You mean, people like Scott Clarke. That was a joke.
Hopper: [exhales sharply] Mm. [chuckles]
[clanging]
Joyce: What's that?
Hopper: Wait here.
[he leaves the room and looks around] 
[rattling]
