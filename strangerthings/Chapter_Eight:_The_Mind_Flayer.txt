Script: 
[low growling]
[a demodog climbs out of the hole]
[growling]
Owens: Mother of God.
[the demodog growls softly]
[one tries to get through the glass, snarling]
Owens: It's... it's polycarbonate. It can't get through.
[the demodog growls, calling more]
Technician: Mother Mary and Joseph.
[monsters growling as they hit the glass, cracking it]
Hopper: You sure about that glass?
[alarm blaring]
Bob: What the hell?
Mike: We're too late.
Bob: What?
Mike: We're too late!
Joyce: What's going on?
Mike: We're under attack.
Officer: What's going on down there? Does anybody copy?
Man: Hurry!
[everyone runs out of the room, Hopper closing the door]
[alarm continues blaring]
Owens: Stairs! Stairs!
[elevator bell dings]
[Hopper and Owens run upstairs]
[banging on door]
[monsters snarl as they burst through the door]
[Mike grabs a bottle and a syringe]
Mike: We need to make Will sleep.
Joyce: What?
Mike: He's a spy. If he knows where we are, so does the shadow monster.
Will: He's lying!
Mike: He killed those soldiers. He'll kill us, too!
Will: He's lying! He's lying! He's lying! He's lying! He's lying!
[alarm continues blaring]
[elevator bell dings]
[elevator opens, showing the monsters eating the scientists and snarling]
Officer: Shit!
Bob: Those are gunshots!
Will: He's lying! He's lying!
Joyce: Okay, Will, Will, listen, listen. Do you know who I am? Do you know who I am?
Will: You're... You're... You're Mom.
Joyce: Hold him down.
Will: No! No! Let go! No! No! Let me go! Let go! No, let me go!
Joyce: I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.
Will: Let me go! Let go! Let me go! No! Let go! Let me go! Let me go!
[alarm continues blaring]
[Joyce injects him]
[Hopper bursts in, panting]
[monsters growling]
[the monsters try breaking through another door]
Hopper: We gotta go. We gotta go.
[he picks up Will and rushes off with everyone]
[a monster tackles someone in front of them, snarling]
[rapid gunfire]
Hopper: Come on!
[he leads them into an open room]
[Joyce whimpers]
[Bob looks at the surveillance TVs in the room]
Bob: Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
[monsters screech as the power goes out]
[song playing on car radio]
Susan: Hey, guys, we're home. Guys? Hello? Max?
[she checks Max's room, sees it's empty and sighs]
[rock music playing in Billy's room]
[he gets ready for a date]
[Susan knocks on door]
Susan: Billy?
Billy: Yeah, I'm a little bit busy in here, Susan.
Neil: Open the door. Right now.
[he sighs and stops checking himself out to open the door]
Billy: What's wrong?
Neil: Why don't you tell us?
Billy: Because I don't know.
Susan: We can't find Maxine.
Neil: And her window's open. Where is she?
Billy: I don't know.
Neil: You don't know? [scoffs]
Billy: Look, I'm sure she just, I don't know, went to the arcade or something. I'm sure she's fine.
Neil: You were supposed to watch her.
Billy: [sighs] I know, Dad. I was. It's just you guys were three hours late, and, well, I have a date. [sighs] I'm sorry, okay?
Neil: That's why you've been staring at yourself in the mirror like some faggot instead of watching your sister?
Billy: I have been looking after her all week, Dad. Okay? She wants to run off, then that's her problem, all right? She's 13 years old. She shouldn't need a full-time babysitter. And she's not my sister!
[music stops]
[Billy grunts as Neil pins him to the wall]
[Billy pants]
Neil: What did we talk about?
[Billy groans as Neil slaps him]
Neil: What did we... talk about?
Billy: Respect and responsibility.
Neil: That is right. Now, apologize to Susan.
Billy: [breathing heavily] I'm sorry, Susan.
Susan: It's okay, Neil, really-
Neil: No, it's not okay. Nothing about his behavior is okay. But he's gonna make up for it. He's gonna call whatever whore he's seeing tonight and cancel their date. And then he's gonna go find his sister. Like the good, kind, respecting brother that he is. Isn't that right, Billy? Isn't that right?
Billy: [softly] Yes, sir.
Neil: [sighs deeply] I'm sorry, I couldn't hear you.
Billy: Yes, sir.
Neil: Find Max.
[Neil leaves with Susan]
[Billy cries softly as the door closes]
Lucas: You're positive that was Dart?
Dustin: Yes. He had the same exact yellow pattern on his butt.
Max: He was tiny two days ago.
Dustin: Well, he's molted three times already.
Steve: Malted?
Dustin: Molted. Shed his skin to make room for growth like hornworms.
Max: When's he gonna molt again?
Dustin: It's gotta be soon. When he does, he'll be fully grown, or close to it. And so will his friends.
Steve: Yeah, and he's gonna eat a lot more than just cats.
Lucas: Wait, a cat? Dart ate a cat?
Dustin: No, what? No. What are you talking about?
Steve: He ate Mews.
Max: Mews? Who's Mews?
Steve: It's Dustin's cat.
Dustin: Steve!
Lucas: I knew it! You kept him!
Dustin: No! No. No, I... No, I... He missed me. He wanted to come home.
Lucas: Bullshit!
Dustin: I didn't know he was a Demogorgon, okay?
Lucas: Oh, so now you admit it?
Max: Guys, who cares? We have to go.
Lucas: I care! You put the party in jeopardy! You broke the rule of law!
Dustin: So did you!
Lucas: What?
Dustin: You told a stranger the truth!
Max: [scoffs] A stranger?
Lucas: You wanted to tell her, too!
Dustin: But I didn't, Lucas, okay?
[screeching in distance]
Dustin: I didn't tell her! We both broke the rule of law, okay? So we're even. We're even.
Lucas: No, no! We're not even. Don't even try that. Your stupid pet could have ate us for dinner!
Dustin: That was not my fault!
Steve: Guys?
Dustin: He wasn't gonna eat us.
Lucas: He was crawling to come say hello?
Steve: Guys!
[screeching continues]
[Steve, Dustin and Lucas start heading towards the screeching]
Max: No, no, no. Hey, guys, why are you headed towards the sound? Hello? Hello? Shit.
[she follows them]
[screeching continues]
Dustin: I don't see him.
[Lucas looks through his binoculars]
Lucas: It's the lab. They were going back home.
[growling]
Owens: Look, this is us, and this is the nearest exit. But even if we somehow make it there, there's no way out.
Hopper: What do you mean?
Owens: The locks are fail secure.
Joyce: Fail secure?
Owens: If there's a power outage, the building goes on lockdown.
Bob: Can it be unlocked remotely?
Owens: With a computer, sure, but somebody's gotta reset the breakers.
Hopper: Where are the breakers?
Owens: Breakers are in the basement, three floors down.
[Hopper grabs the map and a torch]
Bob: Hey, where are you going?
Hopper: To reset the breakers.
Bob: Okay, then what?
Hopper: Then we get out of here.
Bob: No, then the power comes back on. If you wanna unlock the doors, you have to reboot the computer system, and then override the security codes with a manual input.
Hopper: Fine, how do I do that?
Bob: You can't. Not unless you know BASIC.
Hopper: I don't know what that means.
Mike: It's a computer programming language.
Hopper: Teach it to me.
Bob: [scoffs] Shall I teach you French while I'm at it, Jim? How about a little German? How about you, Doc? You speak BASIC?
Owens: No. [sighs]
Bob: [scoffs] Okay, I got this. I got this.
Joyce: No. Bob.
Bob: It's okay. [hugs Joyce] It's gonna be okay. Remember, Bob Newby, superhero. [chuckles lightly]
[Hopper grabs a dead officer from the corridor into a stairwell, grunting]
Hopper: Okay, grab his walkie.
[Bob grunting and panting]
Hopper: [picks up the gun]All right, you know how to use one of these?
Bob: [panting] No.
Hopper: Safety on. Safety off. Point. Squeeze.
Bob: Point and squeeze. Okay. Easy-peasy.
Hopper: If anything happens down there, I want you to come right back up. 
Bob: Right back here. Listen. Don't wait for me. As soon as I get those doors open...
Hopper: I'm gonna get them out.
Bob: Yeah?
Hopper: I promise.
Bob: Okay, well... I'll be in touch.
[Jonathan's car pulls up]
Jonathan: Why are the lights off?
Nancy: Maybe it's closed?
Jonathan: Security took the night off? I don't think so.
[Jonathan goes into the security box and tries to open the gate]
Nancy: It's not working?
Jonathan: No! The power's off.
Nancy: Jonathan?
Jonathan: What?
[rustling]
Nancy: I think there's something in the woods.
Jonathan: [whispering] Nancy, stay back. Hello? Who's there? Who's there?
[the flashlights move towards them]
Nancy and Jonathan: Steve?
Steve: Nancy?
Dustin: Jonathan.
Nancy: What are you doing here?
Steve: What are you doing here?
Nancy: We're looking for Mike and Will.
Dustin: They're not in there, are they?
Nancy: We're not sure.
Jonathan: Why?
[monsters screeching]
[Bob runs down the stairs quietly with the gun and his torch]
[he makes it to the breaker room]
[air hissing]
[Bob grunts]
[panting]
Bob: Keep it together, Bob. 
[he gets into the control room and gasps when he sees the dead bodies]
Bob: Oh, God. [panting, he closes the door] [grunts as he walks past the bodies] Okay, here we go. [grunts and turns on the power]
[they watch as the lights turn on]
Mike: He made it.
[indistinct chatter]
Steve: We haven't seen Will-
Dustin: I haven't seen him since...
Nancy: The power's back.
[they run to the gate and Jonathan tries the button]
Dustin: Let me try.
Jonathan: Hang on-
Dustin: Let me try, Jonathan! 
[he keeps pushing the button. Like all the other times, it doesn't work]
Dustin: Son of a bitch! You know what...
[Owens flicks a switch]
[beeps]
Owens: Okay, Bob, can you hear us?
Bob: Loud and clear, Doc. Can you hear me back?
Owens: We hear you.
Bob: All right, give me a minute.
[computer beeps]
Bob: [typing] Come on... Open sesame.
[buzzing]
Owens: It's open.
Bob: [still typing] Okay.
[Bob unlocks all the doors of the lab]
[the gate opens]
Dustin: Hey! I got it! [chuckles] I got it!
Bob: Easy-peasy.
Hopper: Son of a bitch did it.
Bob: Right, I'll meet you outside.
Owens: Nice job. Hold on a second, Chief.
Hopper: What's wrong?
Owens: West stairwell's not clear anymore.
Bob: What's going on?
Owens: We've got some company.
Bob: Where?
Owens: The west stairwell.
Bob: I got an idea.
[he goes back to the computer and types]
Owens: What the hell's he doing?
Bob: Okay. And splash.
[monster goes towards the sprinkler, chittering]
Owens: Okay. Okay, that worked. Now, get out of there. Go! Go!
[Bob goes, leaving his gun accidentally]
[Hopper picks up Will and grunts]
Owens: Wait a second, Chief?
Hopper: What?
Owens: Take this.
[hands him a radio]
Hopper: What are you doing?
Owens: Any more surprises, I'll let you know. Go. Go!
[Hopper, Mike and Joyce leave the surveillance room]
[Bob runs up the stairs, panting]
[Hopper, Mike and Joyce run to the exit]
[Joyce looks back, staying still]
Joyce: Come on, Bob. Come on.
Owens: Hey, Bob?
Bob: Yeah?
Owens: I'm gonna guide you, okay?
Bob: Is there a problem?
Owens: No, it's just... It's, uh, getting a little crowded up here, so we're gonna have to take this slow.
Bob: Okay.
Owens: All right, just start walking. Okay, good. Okay, now, your next right. Now, keep going, keep going, keep going... 
[Bob panting]
Owens: Stop!
Bob: [panting] What? What?
Owens: Bob, there's a door on your left, do you see that?
Bob: Yeah?
Owens: That's a closet.
Bob: Okay?
Owens: Yeah, I need you to get in it.
Bob: What?
Owens: Now! Right now. Get in the closet.
[Bob gets in the closet and turns off his torch, panting]
[monster growling softly]
[monster growling]
[Bob watches the shadow walk away, gasping]
Owens: Jesus Christ. Okay. How you holding up there, Bob? You all right?
Bob: Yeah. Yeah.
Owens: You got a pretty clear shot to the front door.
Bob: Okay. 
Owens: You can do this, okay? You're almost home free, all right, Bob?
[Bob opens the door, panting]
[as he gets out, a broom falls to the floor, thudding]
Owens: Run!
[monster screeches]
[Bob runs and screams]
[monster growling]
[Bob gets through a door and closes it, the monster screeching]
Joyce: Bob! [panting] Bob.
[Bob turns to look at her and smiles]
[suddenly, a monster tackles Bob to the ground, screeching]
[Joyce screaming]
[the monster stabs Bob with its claws, Bob screaming]
Joyce: No! 
[Hopper runs in] 
Joyce: No!
[Hopper shoots at the monster as it bites Bob]
[more monsters burst in and Hopper tries to shoot them]
Hopper: Let's go!
Joyce: No!
[Hopper drags Joyce outside]
Hopper: Go!
Joyce: Bob!
[door buzzing]
Joyce: Bob! No!
Mike: [holding Will] What happened?
Joyce: No!
[the monsters slam into the doors, screeching]
Joyce: No!
Hopper: He's gone! He's gone!
[horn honking]
Jonathan: Come on! Get in!
[the monsters screech from inside]
Max: Guys?
[horn honking as Jonathan and Hopper drive towards them]
Steve: Outta the way!
Max: Look out!
[Hopper parks in front of them as Jonathan drives off]
Hopper: Let's go.
Steve: Come on!
[the kids all pile in]
Steve: Come on, let's go! Let's go! Come on! Okay! Let's go!
[monsters continue eating Bob, growling]
[Will is still unconscious]
Jonathan: I'm sorry, bud. Sorry I wasn't there. I should have been here.
[Hopper is on the phone]
Hopper: Sam Owens. Dr. Sam Owens.
Woman: How many people at the lab?
Hopper: I don't know how many people are there! I don't know how many people are left alive!
Woman: Have you contacted the police?
Hopper: I am the police! Chief Jim Hopper!
Woman: Is there a number I can reach you at?
Hopper: Yes, the number that I gave you, yes. 
Woman: Okay, yes, I got it.
Hopper: 6767... I will be here.
Woman: I'll have them contact you.
[Hoper puts the phone down]
Dustin: They didn't believe you, did they?
Hopper: We'll see.
Mike: "We'll see"? We can't just sit here while those things are loose!
Hopper; We stay here, and we wait for help.
[Hopper goes to Joyce's room and knocks softly]
[he sits in front of Joyce and grunts softly]
Mike: Did you guys know that Bob was the original founder of Hawkins AV?
Lucas: Really?
Mike: He petitioned the school to start it and everything. Then he had a fund-raiser for equipment. Mr. Clarke learned everything from him. Pretty awesome, right?
Dustin and Lucas: Yeah.
Mike: We can't let him die in vain.
Dustin: What do you want to do, Mike? The Chief's right on this. We can't stop those Demo-dogs on our own.
Max: Demo-dogs?
Dustin: Demogorgon dogs. Demo-dogs. It's like a compound. It's like a play on words-
Max: Okay.
Dustin: I mean, when it was just Dart, maybe...
Lucas: But there's an army now.
Dustin: Precisely.
Mike: His army.
Steve: What do you mean?
Mike: His army. Maybe if we stop him, we can stop his army, too.
[Mike takes them to Will's room and shows them the drawing]
Dustin: The shadow monster.
Mike: It got Will that day on the field. The doctor said it was like a virus, it infected him.
Max: And so this virus, it's connecting him to the tunnels?
Mike: To the tunnels, monsters, the Upside Down, everything.
Steve: Whoa. Slow down. Slow down.
Mike: Okay, so, the shadow monster's inside everything. And if the vines feel something like pain, then so does Will.
Lucas: And so does Dart.
Mike: Yeah. Like what Mr. Clarke taught us. The hive mind.
Steve: Hive mind?
Dustin: A collective consciousness. It's a super-organism.
Mike: And this is the thing that controls everything. It's the brain.
Dustin: Like the mind flayer.
Max: The what?
Steve: What?
[Dustin grabs a monster manual for DandD]
Dustin: The mind flayer.
Hopper: What the hell is that?
Dustin: It's a monster from an unknown dimension. It's so ancient that it doesn't even know its true home. Okay, it enslaves races of other dimensions by taking over their brains using its highly-developed psionic powers.
Hopper: Oh, my God, none of this is real. This is a kids' game.
Dustin: No, it's a manual. And it's not for kids. nd unless you know something that we don't, this is the best metaphor-
Lucas: Analogy.
Dustin: Analogy? That's what you're worried about? Fine. An analogy for understanding whatever the hell this is.
Nancy: Okay, so this mind flamer thing-
Dustin: Flayer. Mind flayer.
Nancy: [sighs] What does it want?
Dustin: To conquer us, basically. It believes it's the master race.
Steve: [stammers] Like the Germans?
Dustin: Uh, the Nazis?
Steve: Yeah, yeah, yeah, the Nazis.
Dustin: Uh... If the Nazis were from another dimension, totally. Uh, it views other races, like us, as inferior to itself. It wants to spread, take over other dimensions.
Lucas: We are talking about the destruction of our world as we know it.
Steve: That's great. That's great. That's really great. Jesus!
Nancy: Okay, so if this thing is like a brain that's controlling everything, then if we kill it...
Mike: We kill everything it controls.
Dustin: We win.
Lucas: Theoretically.
Hopper: Great. So how do you kill this thing? Shoot it with Fireballs or something?
Dustin: [chuckles] No. No, no Fire- No Fireballs. Uh, you summon an undead army, uh, because... [stammering] ...because zombies, you know, they don't have brains, and the mind flayer, it... it... It likes brains. It's just a game. It's a game.
Hopper: What the hell are we doing here?
Dustin: I thought we were waiting for your military backup.
Hopper: We are!
Mike: Even if they come, how are they gonna stop this? You can't just shoot this with guns.
Hopper: You don't know that! We don't know anything!
Mike: We know it's already killed everybody in that lab.
Lucas: And we know the monsters are gonna molt again.
Dustin: And we know that it's only a matter of time before those tunnels reach this town.
Joyce: They're right. We have to kill it. I want to kill it.
Hopper: Me, too.
Joyce: I-
Hopper: Me, too, Joyce, okay? But how do we do that? We don't exactly know what we're dealing with here.
Mike: No. But he does. If anyone knows how to destroy this thing, it's Will. He's connected to it. He'll know its weakness.
Max: I thought we couldn't trust him anymore. That he's a spy for the mind flayer now.
Mike: Yeah, but he can't spy if he doesn't know where he is.
[Hopper opens the door and turns on the light]
Hopper: Yeah, this'll work.
[he empties the shed, grunting]
[Steve and Nancy cover all exits and any openings]
Nancy: Hey. What you did, um, helping the kids... that was... really cool.
Steve: Yeah. Those little shits are real trouble, you know?
Nancy: Believe me, I know.
[Dustin and Lucas look through the trash]
Dustin: Hey. I'm... I'm sorry about Dart and all. I guess I just thought that he was my friend. I was wrong. I broke the rule of law, so if you want your girlfriend to take over my spot in the party, I understand.
Lucas: She's not my girlfriend. 
Dustin: I saw you two holding hands in the bus, Lucas.
Lucas: She was just scared.
Dustin: Maybe, but I could feel it.
Lucas: Feel what?
Dustin: The electricity.
[Lucas sighs as Dustin walks away]
[Max and Mike work on finding things in the kitchen]
Max: I get why El was your mage now.
Mike: What?
Max: Lucas. He told me all about her.
Mike: Well, he shouldn't have. And just because you know the truth, it doesn't mean you're in our party. You do know that, right?
Max: Yeah, I know. I mean, why would you want a stupid zoomer in your party anyway? I'm just saying, El? She sounds like she was really awesome.
Mike: Yeah, she was. Until that thing took her. Just like it took Bob.
Jonathan: You sure this is gonna work?
Joyce: He knew who I was. He's still in there. It's gonna work. It has to.
[the gang continue covering up the inside of the shed with trash so Will won't recognise it]
[Jonathan carries him in and they tie him to a chair and post]
[Joyce gets some syringes ready and Mike ties lights to the top of the posts]
Hopper: All right, you ready?
Joyce: Yeah.
[Hopper shakes the bottle of bleach and puts some on a cotton pad]
[he holds the pad under Will's nose so he wakes up]
[Will gasps as wakes up]
[everyone but Joyce, Hopper, Mike, Jonathan and Will are hiding in the Byers house]
Max: If he finds out where we are... will he send those dogs after us?
Lucas: He won't find out.
Max: Yeah, but, if he does...
Lucas: Judgment day.
Will: [grunts] What? What? What is this? What? What is this? Why am I tied up?
Joyce: Will, we just wanna talk to you. We're not gonna hurt you.
Will: Where am I?
[Hopper shows him his drawing of the mind flayer]
Hopper: You recognize this? Do you recognize this?
Joyce: Hey. We wanna help you. But to do that, we have to understand how to kill it.
Will: Why am I tied up? Why am I tied up? Why am I tied up? Why am I tied up?
Hopper: Hey.
Will: Why am I tied up? Why am I tied up? Let me go! Let me go! Let me go! Let me go! 
[the lights start flickering in the house and in the shed]
Will: [screams] Let me go! Let me go! Let me go! Let me go! Let me go! Let me go! Let me go! Let me go! Let me go! Let me go! Let me go... Go... Go...
Joyce: Do you know what March 22nd is? It's your birthday. Your birthday. When you turned eight, I gave you that huge box of crayons. Do you remember that? It was 120 colors. And all your friends, they got you Star Wars toys, but all you wanted to do was draw with all your new colors. And you drew this big spaceship, but it wasn’t from a movie. [stammers] It was your spaceship. A rainbow ship is what you called it. And you must have used every color in the box. I took that with me to Melvald's and I put it up and I told everyone who came in, "My son drew this." And you were so embarrassed. [chuckles] But I was so proud. I was so, so proud. 
Jonathan: [breathing shakily] Do you remember the day Dad left? We stayed up all night building Castle Byers... just the way you drew it. And it took so long because you were so bad at hammering.
[both Joyce and Jonathan chuckle]
Jonathan: You'd miss the nail every time. And then it started raining, but we stayed out there anyway. We were both sick for like a week after that. But we just had to finish it, didn't we? We just had to.
Mike: Do you remember the first day that we met? It was... It was the first day of kindergarten. I knew nobody. I had no friends and... [sniffling] I just felt so alone and so scared, but... I saw you on the swings and you were alone, too. You were just swinging by yourself. And I just walked up to you and... I asked. I asked if you wanted to be my friend. And you said yes. You said yes. It was the best thing I've ever done.
Joyce: Will, baby... if you're in there, just please... please talk to us. Please, honey, please, can you do that for me? Please. I love you so much. [breathing shakily]
Will: Let me go.
[Joyce sighs]
[Mike sniffles]
[Hopper notices Will tapping on the chair]
[Hopper bursts in with Jonathan, Mike and Joyce]
[Hopper gets out some paper and starts writing down the pattern Will tapped]
Dustin: What happened?
Hopper: [sighs] I think he's talking, just not with words.
Steve: What is that?
Boys: Morse code.
Hopper: H-E-R-E. 
Boys: Here.
Hopper: Will's still in there. He's talking to us.
[Jonathan grabs his cassette player and a cassette]
["Should I Stay Or Should I Go?" playing]
Jonathan: Do you remember the first time I played you this? Mom and Dad were both arguing in the next room. So I played you the mix tape I made you. And it was the first time you got into music. Real music.
[Hopper copies Will's taps with a walkie talkie]
Dustin: Dash, dot, dash, dot.
[Lucas translates with Max]
Lucas: Yeah, got it.
Max: C.
Mike: And then the party escaped into the sewers, and there were those big insect things, and you guys were still on level one.
[Hopper copies the taps, the walkie talkie beeping]
Lucas: L. O.
Mike: Then you cast Fog Cloud and you saved us. You saved the whole party.
[walkie talkie beeping]
Lucas: S.
Joyce: You saw that little girl and she was in the sandbox and she was crying.
Lucas: E.
Joyce: You gave her your Tonka Truck and I told you we couldn't afford to buy another one.
Lucas: G.
Joyce: You said she should have it because she's sad. "She's sad, Mommy."
Lucas: A.
Joyce: I love you so much.
Lucas: T.
Joyce: So, so much.
Lucas: E.
All: "Close gate."
[phone ringing]
Dustin: Shit. Shit.
[Dustin picks it up and puts it back, grunting]
[telephone continues ringing]
[Nancy rips the phone off the wall and throws it away]
[Nancy sighs]
Max: Do you think he heard that?
Steve: It's just a phone. It could be anywhere. Right?
[Will's eyes close]
Joyce: Hey. Hey, can you hear me?
[Will breathing heavily and panting]
Hopper: It knows. It knows where we are.
Joyce: Oh, shit.
[Joyce injects Will and he falls asleep]
[monsters screeching in distance]
Dustin: That's not good.
Jonathan: They're coming!
Joyce: What?
Hopper: Come on. We gotta go.
[they untie Will]
Jonathan: Come on.
Hopper: We gotta go.
Jonathan: Okay.
Hopper: Come on, come on. Let's go. Let's go.
[they run into the house with Will]
[Hopper grabs a rifle on the way in and another by the door]
Hopper: Hey. Hey, get away from the windows!
Hopper: [holds up a rifle] Do you know how to use this?
Jonathan: What?
Hopper: Can you use this?
Nancy: I can.
[Hopper and Nancy cock their guns, Steve readies himself with his bat]
[screeching in distance]
Max: Where are they?
[Max hides behind Lucas with his wrist rocket]
[Mike is holding a small golden trophy]
[monsters growling]
[loud thudding]
Nancy: What are they doing?
[snarling]
[monster groaning]
[monster screeching]

[Mike steps forward, about to cry]
[they smile at each other]
