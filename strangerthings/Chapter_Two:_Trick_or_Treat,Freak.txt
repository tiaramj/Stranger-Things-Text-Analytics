Script: 
[Eleven's voice echoing] Goodbye, Mike.
[yelling]
[screeching]
[Eleven wakes up and coughs]
[she groans]
Eleven: Mike? Mike?
[breathing heavily]
Eleven: Mike? Mike! [screaming] Mike! Mike!
[she whimpers]
[soldiers shouting indistinctly]
[muffled explosion]
Soldier 1: Bravo team, check in.
[Eleven breathing heavily]
[soldiers conversing indistinctly]
[Eleven grunts and climbs through the gate at the school]
[Eleven panting]
[she sees police cars outside Mike's house]
Karen: What about the Russians? What if they come looking for her?
Agent: They don't know where she is. And she can't contact you without us knowing.
Agent 2 The most important thing is for you to try to go on with your lives and to keep all of this-
Ted: Top secret. Yeah. Understood. We're all patriots in this house.
Agent 3: Go back to the beginning.
Mike: I told you everything.
Agent 3: I understand this is difficult, Michael.
Mike: I don't know where she is. And even if I did, I'd never tell you. I would never tell you.
[Eleven appears outside and listens in]
Agent 3: I know it's difficult to accept, the stories she told you were not true. She's a very dangerous individual.
[Mike looks outside and sees Eleven]
Agent 4: If she contacts you, you must tell us.
Agent 3: Otherwise, you're putting yourself and your entire family at risk. Do you understand, Michael? Do you understand?
Agent 4:  Michael? Michael? [looks outside]
[agents leave the house]
Agent 4: Fan out. Somebody check the left side, I'll check the right side.
[Eleven hides in Mirkwood]
[helicopter blades whirring]
[men shouting indistinctly]
[Hopper makes breakfast and turns around]
[Eleven has a sheet over her]
Hopper: Oh, Jesus
Eleven: Ghost.
Hopper: Yeah, I see that.
Eleven: Halloween.
Hopper: Sure is. But right now, it's breakfast, okay? Come on, let's eat.
Eleven: They wouldn't see me.
Hopper: Who wouldn’t see you?
Eleven: The bad men.
Hopper: What are you talking about?
Eleven: Trick or treat.
Hopper: You want to go trick-or-treating? You know the rules.
Eleven: Yes, but-
Hopper: Yeah, so you know the answer.
Eleven: No, but they wouldn't see me.
Hopper: No. Hey. I don't care. 
Eleven: But they wouldn’t see me.
Hopper: I don't care, all right? You go out there, ghost or not, it's a risk. We don't take risks. All right? They're stupid, and...
Eleven: We're not stupid!
Hopper: Exactly. Now, you take that off, sit down and eat. Your food's getting cold. [sighs] All right, look... How about I get off early tonight, and I buy us a bunch of candy, and we can sit around and get fat, and we watch a scary movie together? How's that for a compromise?
Eleven: [stutters] "Compromise"?
Hopper: C-O-M-promise. Compromise. How about that's your word for the day? Yeah? It's something that's kinda in-between. It's like halfway happy.
Eleven: By 5-1-5?
Hopper: 5:15. Yeah, sure.
Eleven: Promise?
Hopper: Yes. I promise.
Eleven: Halfway happy.
[Hopper ruffles Eleven's hair]
[Eleven chuckles]
Joyce: Will? Come on, honey, up and at 'em. Will? Jonathan?
Jonathan: Yeah?
Joyce: Where's Will?
Jonathan: What?
Joyce: Where's Will?
Jonathan: He's not in his room?
Joyce: No. Uh... 
[Joyce bursts into the bathroom]
Joyce: Will? What are you doing?
Will: Peeing?
Joyce: [chuckles] Okay.
[toilet flushes]
[cuts to Joyce zipping up Will's costume]
Joyce: Okay. Let's get this... on. [grunts] Oh! You need some tape. Hold on. 
[Joyce picks up one of Will's drawing]
Joyce: What's this?
Will: Nothing.
Joyce: Did you have another episode?
Will: No, it's just, um... a sketch for a story I'm writing.
[Joyce sighs] 
Joyce: All right.
Jonathan: Three, two, one...
[Jonathan takes a picture]
Jonathan: Great. Hold up the proton blaster. All right, now turn to the light.
Claudia: Oh! I want to see those pearls. Yeah!
[meows]
Claudia: Who you gonna call? [scatting] [laughs] Oh! 
Mrs. Sinclair: Adorable, baby. Just adorable!
Erica: God. You are such a nerd.
Lucas: Shut up.
Erica: No wonder you only hang out with boys.
Mrs. Sinclair: Erica!
Erica: Just the facts. [mouthing] Nerd.
Mrs. Sinclair: My God, I love this costume. Keep it up.
Mike: All right, that's the last one.
Karen: No, just one more. Come on, please? Ah!
Mike: Can I go to school?
Karen: Wait, wait. Okay, say, "Who you gonna call?"
Mike: No!
[Lucas, Mike and Dustin bike to school singing the Ghostbusters Theme]
Lucas, Mike and Dustin: ♪ Who you gonna call? ♪
Will: ♪ Ghostbusters! ♪
Mike: Hey, Spengler!
Lucas: Egon! Yeah!
Will: Venkman!
Mike: Whoa! Whoa!
Lucas: What?
Mike: Why are you Venkman?
Lucas: Because I'm Venkman.
Mike: No, I'm Venkman.
Will: Why can't there be two Venkmans?
Mike: Because there's only one Venkman in real life. We planned this months ago. I'm Venkman, Dustin's Stantz, you're Egon, and you're Winston.
Lucas: I specifically didn't agree to Winston.
Mike: Yes, you did!
Will: I don't think he did.
Lucas: No one wants to be Winston, man.
Mike: What's wrong with Winston?
Lucas: What's wrong with Winston? He joined the team super late, he's not funny, and he's not even a scientist!
Mike: Yeah, but he's still cool.
Lucas: If he's cool, then you be Winston.
Mike: I can't!
Lucas: Why not?
Mike: [stutters] Because...
Lucas: [mocking Mike] Because you're not black?
Mike: I didn't say that!
Lucas: You thought it.
Mike: I didn't say that!
Lucas: Mike!
Dustin: Guys... Guys! Guys! Why is no one else wearing costumes?
[school bell ringing]
Lucas: Crap.
[they head into school and walk through the corridors]
[students laughing]
Student: Oh, my God!
Dustin: When do people make these decisions?
Will: Everyone dressed up last year.
Dustin: It's a conspiracy, I'm telling you.
Mike: Just be cool.
Student 2: Who you gonna call? The nerds!
[They open their lockers and watch Max skate past]
Dustin: We gonna do this?
Lucas: Not right now. We look like morons.
Dustin: Maybe she likes Ghostbusters?
Lucas: Of course she likes Ghostbusters, but that's not the point. The point is we're dressed up and she isn't.
Dustin: I didn't bring regular clothes. You?
Lucas: No. 
Dustin: Then we have no choice. We gotta do this. It's now or never.
Lucas: Right. [sniffs]
Dustin: Let's engage.
[Max leaves her locker]
Dustin: We could ask her after class.
Lucas: Yup.
Dustin: Okay.
[Joyce compares Will's drawing to the landscape outside the house]
Joyce: See? It's an exact match. But... why would he lie to me?
Hopper: [inhales deeply] He's a kid, Joyce.
Joyce: I mean, you heard him describe these episodes. It's not like he's describing a nightmare. He talks about them like they're real.
Hopper: Yeah, because they're not nightmares, they're flashbacks. I know a couple guys who have had these things, and it feels like you're there, like it's happening.
Joyce: Then what the hell is this?
Hopper: Owens said it would get worse. 
Joyce: That place...
Hopper: What do you wanna do? You wanna take him back to Chicago?
Joyce: Well, there's that guy in Boston that's supposed to be-
Hopper: They're all a bunch of quacks. They'll all tell you the same thing, just cost you more money. I think he's right... about trauma. And we're coming up on a year, you know. I think everybody's on edge. Me, you... Will most of all. I think we just gotta get through the next few weeks. [sighs] Nothing's gonna go back to the way that it was. Not really. But it'll get better. In time. [sighs heavily]
[Joyce mumbles]
Hopper: Here.
[Hopper hands her his cigarette]
Joyce: Thank you.
[she chokes and coughs]
[Hopper chuckles]
Joyce: Jesus! Hopper...
Hopper: Brings me back to old times.
Joyce: What?
Hopper: [sighs] Sharing my cigarettes between...
Joyce: Fifth and sixth period.
Joyce: We ran. We just ran. [chuckles] God, I want this to be over.
Hopper: I know.
[Joyce sniffles]
[agent suits up to go near the gate]
[beeps]
[agent goes through the gate]
[static crackling]
Owens: How's it looking out there, cowboy?
Agent: Uh, you know, Doc. The usual. Nice and nasty with a chance of radioactivity Oh, yeah, it's barbecued all right. Anyone hungry?
Technician: And...
[beeping]
Technician: ...we're back on!
[cheering and applauding]
[Owens watches the recording of Will's checkup]
Will: There was this storm.
Owens: Okay. So how did you feel when you saw the storm?
Will: I felt frozen.
Owens: Actually frozen? Cold?
Will: No, like how you feel when you're scared, and you can't breathe or talk or do anything. I felt... I felt this evil.
[Nancy and Steve are working]
[Nancy breaks her pencil and goes to sharpen it]
[she looks around and thinks she sees Barb]
[Barb's voice starts echoing]
Barb: Nancy, this isn't you.
Nancy: Barb, just go ahead and go home, okay?
Barb: Nancy? Nancy!
[Steve comes over and wakes her out of her trance]
Steve: Nancy. What's going on? Are you okay?
Nancy: I can't keep doing this.
Steve: Doing what?
Nancy: Pretending like everything's okay.
Steve: What are you talking about?
Nancy: Barbara. It's like everyone forgot. It's like nobody cares. Except her parents. And now they're selling their house.
Steve: Nance-
Nancy: And they're going to spend the rest of their lives looking for her.
Steve: I know.
Nancy: It's destroying them.
Steve: I know. Okay? I get it. But listen, there's nothing we can do about it.
Nancy: Yeah, we could tell them the truth.
Steve: Well, you know that we can't do that.
Nancy: We don't have to tell them everything. 
Steve: This isn't some game, Nance. If they found out that we told any... They could put us in jail. Okay? Or worse, they could destroy our families. They could do anything they want. Okay? Just think about what you're saying. Hey... Hey, hey... Hey, it's... [sighs] It's hard, but let's... let's just go to Tina's stupid party... wear our stupid costumes that we've been working on for a stupid amount of time, and just pretend like we're stupid teenagers, okay? Can we just do that, just for tonight?
Nancy: Okay.
Steve: Come here.
[Nancy sighs]
[ringing]
Dustin: [clears throat] Um... Hi, Max. I'm Dustin, and this is-
Lucas: Lucas.
Max: Yeah, I know. The stalkers.
Lucas: [stutters] Uh, no. Actually... We weren't stalking you.
Dustin: No, we were just concerned because, you know, you're new and all.
Lucas: Yeah, for your safety.
Dustin: Mmm-hmm. There are a lot of bullies here.
Lucas: [stuttering] So many bullies, it's crazy.
Dustin: Yeah.
Max: Is that why you're wearing proton packs?
Dustin: Well, these don't function. But... I do have this handy-dandy little trap here. And look, it even opens and closes. Look, look, look... Voilà! [chuckles] It's cool, right? No? Okay. But, um... So, we were talking last night, and you're new here, so you probably don't have any friend to take you trick-or-treating, and you're scared of bullies, so we were thinking that it would be okay if you come with us.
Max: "It'd be okay"?
Dustin: Yeah. Our party's a democracy, the majority voted you could come.
Max: Didn't realize it was such an honor to go trick-or-treating with you.
Dustin: We know where to get the full-sized candy bars. We figured you'd want in.
Max: That's presumptuous of you.
Dustin: Yeah. Totally. Uh, so, um... you'll come?
[Max closes her locker and walks off]
Dustin: We're meeting at the Maple Street cul-de-sac at 7:00. That's 7:00 on the dot! "Presumptuous." That's a good thing, right?
[Lucas sighs and walks off]
Dustin: Is it bad? Lucas, is it bad? Lucas? Son of a bitch, Lucas. Is it bad?
[Eleven watches TV]
Advert: How does it feel? Like pouring pure silk onto my skin.
Advert 2: Inhuman. Relentless. Arnold Schwarzenegger is... The Term-
[TV turns to an episode of <i>All My Children</i>]
Erica: Well, I'm stunned. I don't know what to think.
Mike: Don't you love me?
Erica: Of course I love you. It's just that it's so sudden. I mean, it's not like you.
Mike: Erica, I am this way because of you.
Erica: Me?
Eleven: "Me?"
Mike: Mmm-hmm. You have made me wild and impetuous, just like you.
Eleven: "Impetuous."
Erica: People are going to be aghast.
Eleven: "People are going to be aghast."
[Mike laughs] 
Mike: They're gonna love it.
[both laughing on TV]
Erica: I mean, it's gonna stun the whole town. The whole world!
Mike: Erica, tell me that you will marry me, in this house, tonight...
[television continues indistinctly]
[Eleven checks out the window and sees a squirrel]
[chittering]
[chittering]
[Eleven kills the squirrel and cooks it]
[twig snaps]
Hunter: Hey. I'm not gonna hurt you. What's your name? What're you doing out here in the cold?
[Eleven uses her powers to lift a burning log and hit the hunter in the face with it]
[grunts]
[Eleven grabs his coat and hat and runs off]
[Eleven closes the blind]
[tires screeching]
[flies buzzing]
[Hopper sees the truck next to his and checks the back: full of crops like at Merrill's farm]
Hopper: So, you're telling me that Merrill poisoned your farm, because he thinks you poisoned his, which, of course, you didn't?
Eugene: No, sir. And I got me an alibi the night he accuses me. My Jenny and her boys were in town. I was with them all night.
Hopper: Did you actually see Merrill?
Eugene: No need. That man done lost his mind. Went around slandering me, threatening all sorts of madness.
Powell: A pumpkin conspiracy.
Callahan: [chuckles] Hawkins' very own Chinatown.
Hopper: Listen, Merrill threatening to do something and him actually doing something are two very different things.
Eugene: You got a better explanation?
Hopper: Cold weather.
Eugene: It's October.
Hopper: Yeah, it's a cold one.
Eugene: You see these hands?
Hopper: Yeah.
Eugene: You know why they look like that?
Hopper: Because you're old?
Eugene: You're damn straight.
[Powell chuckles]
Eugene: And I've been doing this a long time, Chief. A long time. And I ain't never seen anything the likes of this. None of us have.
Hopper: None of us?
Eugene: Merrill didn't just hit me last night. He hit damn near everyone.
Hopper: What are you talking about?
Eugene: Jack O'Dell, Pete Freeling, Rick Neary, the Christensens. All of their crops, dead.
Hopper: Give me those names again.
[Max skates over to Billy's car]
Billy: You're late again.
Max: Yeah, I had to get catch-up homework.
Billy: Jesus. I don't care. You're late again, and you're skating home. Do you hear me?
["Wango Tango" by Ted Nugent playing]
[song continues on car radio as Billy speeds home]
Billy: God, this place is such a shithole.
Max: It's not that bad.
Billy: No?
[Billy inhales deeply]
Billy: Mmm! You smell that, Max? That's actually shit. Cow shit.
Max: I don't see any cows.
Billy: Clearly, you haven't met the high-school girls. [scoffs] So what, you like it here now?
Max: No.
Billy: Then why are you defending it?
Max: I'm not.
Billy: Sure sounds like it.
Max: It's just we're stuck here, so...
Billy: Hmm. You're right. We're stuck here. And whose fault is that?
Max: Yours.
Billy: What'd you say?
Max: Nothing.
Billy: Did you say it's my fault?
Max: No.
Billy: You know whose fault it is. Say it. Max... say it. Say it!
["Wango Tango" continues playing as he speeds up more]
[Max spots Mike, Dustin and Lucas biking home]
Dustin: Really, everyone dressed up last year.
Max: Billy, slow down.
Billy: Oh, these your new hick friends?
Max: No! I don't know them.
Billy: I guess you won't care if I hit 'em, then? I get bonus points, I get 'em all in one go?
Max: No, Billy, stop. It's not funny.
[revving]
Dustin: Hey, guys?
Max: Billy, come on, stop it. It's not funny. Stop!
Lucas: Go!
Dustin: Mike, you need to haul ass!
Max: Billy, stop it!
[tires screech as Max turns the steering wheel]
Dustin: Whoa! Shit! Shit! Shit! Shit!
Billy: Yeah! That was a close one, huh?
[Billy laughs]
Dustin: Holy shit! Was that...
Lucas: Mad Max.
["Wango Tango" continues playing]
[wind chimes rattling]
[flies buzzing]
Eugene: Now, you tryin' to tell me, with a straight face, cold did this?
Hopper: How far does it go?
[Powell is heard over the radio]
Powell: Hey, Chief, you copy?
Hopper: Uh...
Powell: Hey, Chief.
Hopper: How's it looking over there?
Powell: Like a giant pissed all over Jack's bean field. Smells, too. It smell over there?
Hopper: Uh, yeah, little bit.
Callahan: [grunts] Smells like a nursing home, man.
Hopper: Listen. I want you guys to track the rot, see how far it goes. Just, uh, mark anything that's dead.
Powell: That's gonna take some time.
Hopper: So take it. And, look, we don't know what caused this. Could be poison. So don't touch anything without gloves. 
[Callahan sniffs]
Powell: Copy that, Chief.
[Hopper sighs]
Hopper: You got any marking flags?
Bob: So you hit "T" to zoom in, and "W" zooms back out. See? Easy-peasy. Just make sure to turn off the power to save energy there.
Joyce: Listen. Stay close to your brother, okay? And listen, listen, listen... If you get a bad feeling or anything, you tell him to take you straight home. You promise?
Will: Okay.
Jonathan: Are you ready, bud?
Will: Yeah. 
Joyce: Be safe.
Bob: [imitating Dracula] I hope it doesn't suck! [snickers]
[Joyce chuckles]
[Jonathan drives Will into town]
Jonathan: I just don't get what she sees in him.
Will: What?
Jonathan: Bob.
Will: At least he doesn't treat me different. I mean, I can't even go trick-or-treating by myself. It's lame.
Jonathan: What? You think I'm lame?
Will: No, but it's not like Nancy's coming to watch over Mike, you know?
[Jonathan sighs]
Dustin: Will! Hey!
[car horn honks]
Dustin: Hey, don't cross the streams. Don't cross the streams!
Jonathan: [sighs] Hey, listen.
Will: Yeah?
Jonathan: If I let you go on your own, you promise to stay in the neighborhood?
Will: Yeah! Yeah, yeah, totally.
Jonathan: And be back at Mike's by 9:00.
Will: 9:30?
Jonathan: 9:00.
Will: Yeah.
Jonathan: Deal?
Will: Yeah, deal.
Jonathan: All right. Hey, Will. Don't let any of your spazzy friends use this, all right? [hands Will the camera]
Will: Okay.
Jonathan: [imitating Dracula] I hope it doesn't suck.
[Will chuckles]
Lucas: Will!
Dustin: Egon!
Lucas: Yeah! You ready for tonight, man?
Mike: Awesome!
["Shout at the Devil" by Mötley Crüe playing]
Drunk teens: ...thirty-eight, thirty-nine, forty, forty-one, forty-two!
[all cheering loudly]
Teen: Yeah!
Teen 2: Forty-two! We got ourselves a new Keg King! [chanting] Billy! Billy! Billy!
Billy: That's how you do it, Hawkins!
Teens: Billy! Billy! Billy!
[chanting continues]
Tommy: We got ourselves a new Keg King, Harrington.
Teen: Yeah, that's right!
Teen 2: Yeah. Eat it, Harrington.
[Nancy walks off while Steve and Billy square off]
Nancy: What's in this?
Teen 3: Pure fuel! Pure fuel! Whoo! [burps]
[glasses shattering]
Steve: Hey... Whoa, whoa! Hey... Whoa, whoa, whoa! Take it easy. Take it easy. Nance, Nance, Nance...
Nancy: We're just being stupid teenagers for the night. Wasn't that the deal?
[Nancy downs her drink and walks off]
["Islands in the Stream" by Dolly Parton and Kenny Rogers playing]
Bob: [chuckles] Yeah.
[Joyce chuckling]
Joyce: No. No, no.
Bob: Come on. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Come on.
Joyce: No. No. No. [laughing]
Bob: [starts dancing with her] Oh, there it is. [chuckles] You playing Frankenstein to my Dracula? Come on, you're stiff as a board. Relax.
Joyce: I'm sorry. It's...
Bob: He's fine. Okay? Jonathan's with him.
Joyce: [sighs] I know. It's just every time he's away from me, it's like I can't function. I know it sounds silly.
Bob: No, it's not silly. It's not silly. What if we were to move out of Hawkins... together?
Joyce: What?
Bob: I know. Whoa, Nellie, right? No, I just... I've been thinking about what you said. About how we've got all these memories here, and you wish you had enough money to move. Well, my parents are selling their house in Maine. There's a RadioShack nearby. I'm sure they'd take me on. We could just... My turn to be silly now.
Joyce: [sighs] Bob...
Bob: No, it's fine. Wine makes me crazy.
Joyce: Oh, it's just so hard to explain. It's just this... This is not a normal family.
Bob: It could be. It could be.
[doorbell rings]
[knocking on door]
Bob: Finally. [puts the fake teeth in] Huh? [imitates Dracula] Victims. [knocking and ringing continues]
[door opens to Mike, Lucas, Will and Dustin]
All: Trick or treat!
Lady: [chuckles] Oh! Well, aren't you cute? The little exterminators.
[Lucas sighs]
Lucas: If I get another 3 Musketeers, I'm gonna kill myself.
Dustin: What's wrong with 3 Musketeers?
Lucas: "What's wrong with 3 Musketeers?" 
Mike: No one likes 3 Musketeers.
Will: Yeah, it's just nougat.
Dustin: Whoa. "Just nougat"? Just nougat? It is top three for me.
Lucas: Top three?
Dustin: Top three!
Mike: Oh, God. Give me a break.
Dustin: Seriously, I can just eat a whole bowl of nougat. Straight up.
[Max jumps out in a mask]
[boys scream]
[Lucas squeals]
Max: [takes off the mask, chuckling] Holy shit! You should have seen the look on your faces. And you? Who screams like that? You sound like a little girl. Hey, you guys coming or not? Oh, I heard we should hit up Loch Nora. That's where the rich people live, right? [chuckles]
Dustin and Lucas: Yeah!
Mike: [sighs]
[Hopper marking the dead plants]
[gunshots]
[Hopper gasps and sighs]
Grandkid: You're dead.
Hopper: Yeah, you got me, kid.
[toy gun firing]
[kid chuckles]
Hopper: Happy Halloween. [realises the time] Oh, shit, shit, shit, shit, shit, shit, shit. [groans and drives off] [turns back and looks at the grandkid] Hey, kid. Give me some of that candy, would you?
Grandkid: No way.
[Hopper gets out $5]
Hopper: All right. How about now?
[Eleven watches Frankenstein on TV]
Maria: Who are you? I'm Maria. Will you play with me? Would you like one of my flowers?
[radio startsbeeping]
[Eleven gets up quickly]
Eleven: L... A... T... E. Late.
[continues beeping]
[Eleven wanders through the woods]
[she spots the lock box and checks inside]
[grabs the Eggos and runs off]
["Monster Mash" playing]
Dustin: Another full-size. Like, seriously, rich people are such suckers. Wait. You're not rich, right?
Max: No, I live up Old Cherry Road.
Dustin: Oh.
Max: No, it's fine. I mean, the street's good for skating.
Dustin: Hmm. Yeah, totally tubular. What? Did I say that right? Or is it, like, tubular.
Lucas: It's, like, [imitates surfer] totally tubular.
Dustin: Totally tubular!
Lucas: What a gnarly wave, dude.
Dustin: Totally brodacious, bro!
Max: Stop. My ears are hurting.
[Dustin and Lucas continue indistinctly]
Mike: Did you agree to this?
Will: What?
Mike: To her joining our party.
Will: It's just for Halloween.
Mike: You should have checked with me.
Will: Well, they were excited. I guess I thought you'd be okay with it.
Mike: She's ruining the best night of the year.
[Mike heads on to catch up with the others]
[Will pauses before following him]
Kid: Watch it, Zombie Boy.
[Will gasps]
Kid 2: Trick or treat, freak.
Kid 3: Boo!
[Will gasps and falls over]
[Will lands]
[ambient rumbling]
Will: Mike? Mike? Mike!
[chittering]
[chittering continues]
[ominous loud rumbling]
[loud growling]
[Will runs away from the creature and hides, breathing heavily]
[Mike grabs Will and brings him back from the Upside Down]
Mike: Will!
[Will screams]
Mike: Will, what's wrong?
[Will breathing heavily]
Mike: I couldn't find you. Are you hurt?
Dustin: Holy shit!
Lucas: Is he okay?
Mike: I don't know. I'm gonna get you home, okay? I'm gonna get you home. Hold on.
Dustin: All right, take it easy.
Mike: I got him.
Dustin: Mike?
Mike: Keep trick-or-treating. I'm bored anyways.
Max: What's wrong with him?
["Girls on Film" by Duran Duran playing]
[retching]
["Girls on Film" continues playing as Jonathan walks inside]
Samantha: Nice costume.
Jonathan: Huh?
Samantha: Nice costume.
Jonathan: Oh, uh, yeah. I'm going as a guy who hates parties.
Samantha: [chuckles] I'm Samantha.
Jonathan: Uh, Jonathan. [he sees Nancy and Steve dancing] Kiss? The band.
[Samantha chuckles]
[Nancy tries to get away from Steve and get more drink, clearly drunk]
Steve: No, no, no.
Nancy: Get off.
Steve: No, you've had enough, okay?
Nancy: Screw you!
Steve: Nance, I'm serious. Hey. Hey. Hey. Stop. No, I'm serious. Put it down.
Nancy: No!
Steve: Nance, put it down.
Nancy: Steve! Stop. Stop. Stop.
[she gasps as the drink goes over her white shirt]
[all exclaim]
Nancy: What the hell?
[she walks off and Steve follows her to the bathroom]
Steve: Nance. Nance, I'm sorry. That's not coming off, Nance.
Nancy: It's coming.
Steve: Come on. Let me just take you home, okay? Come here. Let me take you home. Come on.
Nancy: [slurring] You wanted this.
Steve: No, I didn't want this. I told you to stop drinking.
Nancy: It's bullshit. Bullshit.
Steve: No, it's not bullshit. Okay? No, it's not bullshit, Nancy.
Nancy: No, you. You're bullshit.
Steve: [stammers] What?
Nancy: You're pretending like everything is okay. You know, like we didn't... like we didn't kill Barb. Like, it's great. Like, we're in love and we're partying. Yeah, let's party, huh? Party. We're partying. This is bullshit.
Steve: "Like we're in love"?
[Steve shudders]
Nancy: It's bullshit.
Steve: You don't love me?
Nancy: It's bullshit.
[Steve sighs and leaves, brushing past Jonathan]
Will: It's like... like I'm stuck.
Mike: Like, like, stuck in the Upside Down?
Will: [sighs] No. You know on a View-Master, when it gets, like...
Mike: Caught between two slides?
Will: Yeah. Like that. Like one side's our world, and the other... The other slide is the Upside Down. And... And there was this noise coming from everywhere. And then I saw something.
Mike: The Demogorgon?
Will: No. It was like this huge shadow in the sky. Only, it was alive. And it was coming for me.
Mike: Is this all real? Or is it like the doctors say, all in your head?
Will: I don't know. Just... Just please don't tell the others, okay? They won't understand.
Mike: Eleven would.
Will: She would?
Mike: Yeah. She always did. Sometimes I feel like I still see her. Like she's still around, but she never is. I don't know. Sometimes I feel like I'm going crazy.
Will: Me, too.
Mike: Hey, well, if we're both going crazy, then we'll go crazy together, right?
Will: [chuckles] Yeah. Crazy together. [chuckles softly]
[Nancy is in Jonathan's car]
[he helps her out and to her room]
[Nancy exhales as she lies down]
[Jonathan takes off her shoes for her]
[Nancy sighs]
[Jonathan tucks her in]
Nancy: [grabs his arm] Jonathan? [falls asleep]
[Jonathan leaves the room and turns off the light]
[Hopper rushes up the stairs and knocks rhythmically]
Hopper: Hey, kid. Open up, all right? Look, I know I'm late. I got candy here, all right? I got all the good stuff. Please, will you open the door? I'm gonna freeze to death out here. [breathing heavily as the door unlocks and he goes inside]
[TV playing in El's room]
Hopper: Hey, kid. Open up, would you? I got, uh... stuck somewhere, and I lost track of time. And I'm sorry. El, would you please open the door? El? [sighs] All right.  I'm just gonna be out here by myself, eating all this candy. I'm gonna get fat. It's very unhealthy to leave me out here. Could have a heart attack or something. But, you know, you do what you want.
[Eleven watches TV]
Announcer: One quarter pound of all-American beef, fresh-cut tomato, and four strips of crispy bacon.
Man and woman: Did somebody say bacon?
[Eleven switches channels]
Man: Refreshing lemon-
Woman: ...and they're perfect for dunking. Mmm!
[Eleven blindfolds herself and gets the TV to static]
[voices echoing]
[Mike's voice is heard echoing] 
Mike: It's day 353. I had a bad day today. I don't know. I.. I guess I wish you were here. I mean, we all do. If you're out there, just please give me a sign.
Eleven: Mike.
Mike: Eleven?
[Mike waits for a second before turning off the walkie talkie and leaving his basement]
[she takes off the blindfold and sobs]
Dustin: Tubular. Tubular. Tubular.
[chirping and growling]
Dustin: Mews, is that-
[loud thud]
[noise continues]
Dustin: Shit. Shit. Shit. Shit. [screams as he takes off the trash can lid]
[chittering]
Dustin: Holy sh-
["Ghostbusters" starts playing]
