Script: 
[Barb wakes up at the bottom of the pool. She removes glasses and getsup]
Barb: Hello? (looks around) Nancy? Nancy! Hello!
Demogorgon: (growls)
Barb: (screams)
[Barb tries to escape as it cuts to Steve and Nancy in his room]
Barb: Nancy!
Nancy: (pulls away from Steve)
Steve: Hey, what's the matter?
Nancy: Nothing.
Barb: (screaming as she climbs out of the pool) Nancy!
[Barb gets pulled into the pool]
[Demogorgon starts growling]
[Silence]
Nancy: (puts on Steve's sweatshirt) Steve? Hey, Steve.
Steve: Mmm.
Nancy: I'll... see you tomorrow, okay?
Steve: Mmm-hmm.
[Nancy leaves and passes the pool}
Nancy: Oh! Jesus, you scared me.
Karen: Oh, I scared you?
Nancy: I know, I should have called.
Karen: (loudly) Where have you been? (softly) We agreed on 10:00.
Nancy: After the assembly, some people wanted to get something to eat. I didn't think it'd be a big deal.
Karen: You didn't think to call and let me know? With everything that's been going on?
Nancy: I didn't realize how late it was, okay? I'm sorry, Mom. What more do you want? 
[Nancy starts going upstairs]
[Karen catches the sweatshirt]
Karen: Hey, wait... Whose sweatshirt is that?
Nancy: Steve's.
Karen: Steve's. So is Steve your boyfriend now?
Karen: Nancy?
Nancy: What?
Karen: You can talk to me. You can talk to me. Whatever happened.
Nancy: Nothing happened.
Karen: Nancy.
Nancy: Nothing happened. Can I please go?
[Nancy heads upstairs]
[swing creaking]
[Jonathan wakes up and runs to Will's room hearing Joyce]
Joyce: (softly) Will? Will? Sweetheart, can you hear me? Will... Please... Will... (grunts) It's me. It's me. Just talk to me. Talk to me. Just say... (stammers)
Jonathan: Mom?
Joyce: Jonathan! (stammering) Come here. Come here.
[Jonathan walks into the room with Joyce surrounded by lamps]
Jonathan: Mom, what is this?
Joyce: Come here. Come here. (sniffles)
Jonathan: What's going on?
Joyce: It's Will. It's Will, he's... he's trying to talk to me. (breath trembling)
Jonathan: He's trying to talk to you?
Joyce: Yes, through... through the lights.
Jonathan: Mom-
Joyce: I know. I know. Just... just watch. Will... your brother's here. Can you show him what you showed me, baby? Please... 
[lightbulb flickers]
Joyce: (gasps) Did you see that?
Jonathan: It's the electricity, Mom. (stammering) It's acting up.
Joyce: No.
Jonathan: It's the same thing that fried the phone.
Joyce: No! It is not the electricity, Jonathan. Something is going on here! Yesterday, the wall-
Jonathan: What? What about the wall?
Joyce: I don't know. I don't know.
Jonathan: Mom, first the lights, then the wall?
Joyce: (stammers) I just know that Will is here.
Jonathan: (sighs) No, Mom.
Joyce: (stammering) Maybe if I get more lamps- (gets up)
Jonathan: No, Mom. You don't need more lamps. You need to stop this, okay? He is just lost. People are looking for him, and they're going to find him. 
Joyce: (sits back down) Okay. (stammering) 
Jonathan: This isn't helping.
Joyce: Okay, okay. Okay, I'm sorry. (sniffling) I'm sorry.
Jonathan: Can you do me a favor, Mom? Can you just try and get some sleep?
Joyce: (sniffling) Yeah.
Jonathan: Huh? Can you do that for me?
Joyce: I promise. I will.
Jonathan: Yeah?
Joyce: Yeah. I just need to sit here for a minute. (sniffles)
Jonathan: All right, I'll go make breakfast.
Joyce: Okay.
Jonathan: Yeah?
[Jonathan sighs and leaves the room]
Joyce: (whispers) Will?
[radio static]
Mike: We just tell our parents we have AV Club after school. That'll give us at least a few hours for Operation Mirkwood.
Lucas: You seriously think that the weirdo knows where Will is?
Mike: Just trust me on this, okay? 
Lucas: Okay.
Mike: Did you get the supplies?
Lucas: Yeah. Binoculars... from 'Nam. Army knife... also from 'Nam. Hammer, camouflage bandana... and the wrist rocket.
Dustin: You're gonna take out the Demogorgon with a slingshot?
Lucas: First of all, it's a wrist rocket. And second of all, the Demogorgon's not real. It's made up. But if there is something out there, I'm gonna shoot it in the eye... and blind it.
Mike: (sighs) Dustin, what did you get?
Dustin: Well, alrighty. So, we've got... Nutty Bars, Bazooka, Pez, Smarties, Pringles, Nilla Wafers, apple, banana, and trail mix.
Lucas: Seriously?
Lucas: She shut one door!
Dustin: With her mind! Are you kidding me? That's insane! Imagine all the other cool stuff she could do. Like... I bet... that she could make this fly! Hey. Hey. Okay, concentrate. Okay? 
[Dustin grabs a Millenium Falcon and drops it]
[the Millenium Falcon clatters to the floor]
Dustin: Okay, one more time. Okay. (sighs) Use your powers, okay?
[Dustin picks up the Falcon again and drops it]
[it clatters to the floor again]
Lucas: Idiot.
[Mike sighs] 
Mike: She's not a dog!
Karen: Boys! Time for school! 
[the boys quickly pack away]
Mike: Just stay down here. Don't make any noise, and don't leave. If you get hungry, eat Dustin's snacks, okay?
Karen: Michael!
Mike: Coming! You know those power lines?
Eleven: Power lines?
Mike: Yeah. The ones behind my house?
Eleven: Yes.
Mike: Meet us there, after school.
Eleven   :After school?
Mike: Yeah, Ah. 
[Mike puts his watch on Eleven's wrist]
Mike: When the numbers read three-one-five, meet us there. 
Eleven: "Three-one-five."
Mike: Three-one-five.
[Mike runs upstairs to go to school]
[Nancy walks through the corridor to her locker]
Steve: Hey!
Nancy: (laughs nervously) Hey!
Steve: Is everything okay?
Nancy: Yeah! Yeah, totally. I just... I feel like everyone's... staring at me.
Steve: Oh, I didn't... I didn't tell anyone.
Nancy: I know. I know. Of course not. But what about, like, Tommy, and Carol and them?
Steve: You're being paranoid.
Nancy: I'm sorry
Steve: No. No, it's cute Hey... I had a good time.
Nancy: Yeah. Yeah. Me, too.
[both chuckle softly and kiss]
Steve: Mmm. Hmm.
[Steve walks away]
[indistinct chatter]
[Nancy walks in and sits at her desk]
[bell rings]
Nancy: Hey, Ally. Where's Barb?
Ally: Um, shouldn't you know? 
Nancy: You haven't seen her anywhere... at all?
[Ally shakes her head]
Powell: There she is. Emerald City.
Callahan: I heard they make space weapons in there.
Powell: Space weapons?
Callahan: Yeah. You know, like, Reagan's Star Wars. I guess we're gonna blow the Ruskies to smithereens.
Guard: Hey, can I help you?
Hopper: Uh, yeah. We're here for a tour.
Guard: Oh, we don't give tours.
Hopper: Okay... A quick look around.
Guard: You have to get clearance for that. You can contact, uh... Rick Schaeffer at the Department of Energy.
Hopper: Maybe you seen it on TV. We got a local kid that's missing. We have reason to believe he might have snuck in here.
Guard: Like I said,you have to speak to Mr. Schaeffer.
[engine cuts out]
Hopper: What's your name?
Guard: Patrick.
Hopper: Patrick, I got a panicked mayor, and I got reporters breathing down my neck and I got a very upset mother. Now, I know the kid's not in there, but I gotta check off this box. Patrick, would you do me a favor? Would you speak to your boss and see what you can swing for us? I'd really appreciate it. I'm talking ten minutes, tops.
[Eleven practises her powers]
[The Millenium Falcon clatters to the ground]
[static crackling]
[Eleven goes upstairs]
[turns on the TV and flips through the channels]
Ronald Reagan: ...was occupying a large part of Lebanon.
News: Today, Syria has become a home for-
He-Man: I have the power!
Announcer: ...gift that will last forever.
TV: From the Harmony Treasures' collection-
[gospel music playing]
Woman: ♪ On the beach and in the sun, The real thing is so much fun, All the times of your life and the things that you do, Coke is right there with you ♪
[Eleven remembers practising her powers in the lab and turns off the TV]
[Joyce drags the xmas box and gets the lights]
[starts putting them up]
[Joyce buys more xmas lights]
Donald: (sighs) Joyce.
Joyce: Just ring me up, Donald.
Security Officer: And you think this missing boy may have crawled through there?
Hopper: Well, that was the idea.
Security Officer: Yeah, I just don't see how that'd be possible. We've got over 100 cameras. Every square inch covered, plus all my guys. No one breaks in here. Certainly not some kid.
Hopper: Those cameras, you keep the tapes?
Hopper: If you don't mind me asking, what do you guys do in here?
Security Officer: (chuckles) You're asking the wrong guy.
Staying one step ahead of the Russians?
Security Officer: I expect. Something like that.
Hopper: Who's in charge here?
Security Officer: That'd be Dr. Brenner.
Callahan: And he builds the space lasers?
Security Officer: Space lasers?
Hopper: Ignore him.
[tape rewinding]
Hopper: This is the night of the 6th and 7th we're seeing here?
Security Officer: That's correct.
[tape stops]
Hopper: Is that it?
Security Officer: Like I said, we would have seen him.
Hopper: The night of the 7th, we had a search party out for Will. You remember anything about that night?
Callahan: Mmm, not much to remember. Called it off. 
Powell: 'Cause of the storm.
Hopper: Yeah, a lot of rain that night. You see any rain on that tape?
Powell: What are you thinking?
Hopper: I don't know. But they're lying.
[tires screeching]
[Brenner works on an experiment with his scientists]
[Eleven looks around and finds the music box]
[indistinct chatter]
Tommy: That's why science doesn't make any damn sense to me.
Carol: No, I swear. Look at this. It's totally frostbite.
Tommy: Oh, thanks, man. It's a heated pool
Carol: Well, if it's not frostbite, then what is it?
Steve: Ugh, I don't care what it is, it's disgusting! Get it off the table. We're eating here. 
Carol: Ew! 
[Tommy laughs]
Nancy: Hey, Tommy. When you left, did you see Barb?
Tommy: What?
Nancy: Barbara. She's not here today.
Tommy: I seriously have no idea who you're talking about.
Steve: Come on, don't be an ass, man. Did you... Did you see her leave last night or not?
Tommy: No, she was gone when we left.
Carol: Probably couldn't stand listening to all that moaning.
[Tommy chuckles]
[Carol moaning] 
Carol: (loudly) Oh, Steve! Oh, Steve! Oh, Steve! Oh, Steve... Oh, Steve!
[Tommy grunting loudly]
Steve: *mouthing* Okay, chill.
[both laughing]
Steve: Listen... I'm sure she's fine. She's probably just... she's probably just, like, skipping or something.
Nancy: Yeah. Yeah, probably.
[indistinct chatter]
[the boys search for stones for the wrist rocket]
Mike: How about this one?
Dustin: Too big for the sling. So, do you think Eleven was born with her powers, like the X-Men,or do you think she acquired them, like... like Green Lantern?
Lucas: She's not a superhero. She's a weirdo.
Mike: Why does that matter? The X-Men are weirdos.
Lucas: If you love her so much, why don't you marry her?
Mike: What are you talking about?
Lucas: Mike, seriously?
Mike: What?
Lucas: You look at her all, like... "Hi, El! El! El! El! I love you so much! Would you marry me?"
Mike: Shut up, Lucas.
Troy Walsh: Yeah, shut up, Lucas. What are you losers doing back here?
James Dante: Probably looking for their missing friend.
Dustin: That's not funny. It's serious. He's in danger.
Troy Walsh: I hate to break it to you, Toothless, but he's not in danger. He's dead. That's what my dad says. He said he was probably killed by some other queer.
[both laugh]
[both laugh and trip up Mike]
[Mike groans]
Troy Walsh: Watch where you're going, Frogface.
Lucas: You all right?
Mike: Yeah. 
Dustin: (picks up a rock) Hey. How about this one?
Mike: Yeah.
Dustin: Yeah?
Mike: Yeah, this is it.
Lucas: Oh, yeah. Yeah, this is the monster killer!
[Mike laughs]
Lucas: Whoo!
[Jonathan develops his photos from last night]
[Nicole comes in]
Nicole: Hey.
[Jonathan immediately takes down the photos and leaves]
[Joyce has put up all the lights]
[door knocks]
Karen: Hey!
Joyce: Hey, Karen.
Karen: Hi... I brought you a casserole.
Joyce: Oh! Thank you, uh... Uh, you wanna... come in?
[Hopper sighs]
Hopper: Hey, Marissa. How you doin'?
Marissa: You have a lot of nerve showing up here.
Hopper: What?
Marissa: You could have at least called, said, "Marissa! Hey, it's not gonna work out. Sorry I wasted your time. I'm a dick."
Hopper: Yep. I'm sorry. Uh... Maybe we could go out again next week? Newspapers? You guys got newspapers around here?
Marissa: We have the New York Times, the Post, all the big ones. Organized by year and topic. You can find the corresponding microfiche in the reading room.
Hopper: Okay, we're looking for anything on the Hawkins National Laboratory.
Marissa: Well, shouldn't you be looking for that missing kid?
Hopper: Yeah. We are. Uh, so, why don't you start with the Times, and we'll check out the Post. 
[Marissa scoffs and walks away] 
Powell: The librarian?
[timer ticks]
[Joyce chuckles]
Joyce: Will always loved Christmas, you know. So I thought if I... I put the lights up... I don't know, he... I'd feel like he was home somehow. (stammers) It's silly, I know.
Karen: No. No, it's not silly. How is Jonathan holding up?
Joyce: (inhales deeply) You know, he's good at taking care of himself. He always has been, you know? I... (scoffs) I mean, he thinks I'm losing my mind, but...
Karen: Is something the matter?
Joyce: Uh, no No, I just... We're having electrical problems.
Karen: Joyce. I want you to know something. If you need anything, anything at all... Ted and I are here for you.
Joyce: Thank you. Thanks.
Karen: Okay.
[Holly goes wandering towards Will's room]
Joyce: How... how's Mike dealing with this? Is he, uh, okay?
Karen: Mike? Uh... I don't know. He skipped school yesterday. He's never done anything like that before. [gasps]
[low growling]
[timer dings]
Karen: Let me throw in that casserole, okay? Oh, where's Holly?
[breathing heavily]
[Joyce finds Holly in Wills' room]
Joyce: Hey! She shouldn't be here.
Karen: Oh, I'm sorry. She's quite the explorer these days.
Joyce: Wait, did you see something?
Holly: Yeah.
Joyce: What did... what did you see? Tell me. What did you see? What-
Karen: Joyce... Joyce!
Joyce: Listen... Karen, thank you for the casserole, but I need you to leave. Okay?
[Karen sighs]
[line ringing]
Nancy: Come on, come on, come on...
Ms. Holland: Hello?
Nancy: Hi. Hi, uh, Ms. Holland, it's Nancy.
Ms. Holland: Oh, Nancy, how are you?
Nancy: Good. I'm good. Um, I was just wondering, uh, is Barb there?
Ms. Holland: Mmm... No, she hasn't come home yet.
Nancy: But she did come home, right? After the vigil?
Nancy: Right, yes. She did, sorry. I meant, did she come home this morning? I think she left some textbooks and she was gonna go pick them up.
Ms. Holland: Oh, um, no, I haven't seen her.
Nancy: Do- Do you know what? I just remembered... she's at the library.
Ms. Holland: Nancy, will you please have her call me as soon as you find her?
Nancy: Yeah. Yeah, I will. Sorry to bother you.
[Nancy sighs]
[bell rings]
Steve: Hey, man.
Jonathan: What's going on?
Steve: Nicole here was, uh, telling us about your work.
Carol: We've heard great things.
Tommy: Yeah, sounds cool. 
Steve: And we'd just love to take a look. You know, as... connoisseurs of art.
Jonathan: (sighs) I don't know what you're talking about.
Steve: Oh, no? Oh...
Jonathan: Hey. Please, give me my bag. No, just...
Steve: Man, he is totally trembling. He must really have something to hide.
Tommy: Here we go.
Steve: (looks in the bag and pulls out the pictures) Ah... Here we go Oh, man.
Tommy: Let me see. Dude. 
Carol: (scoffs) Yeah, this isn't creepy at all.
Jonathan: I was looking for my brother.
Steve: No. No, this is called stalking. Mmm-hmm.
Nancy: What's going on?
Tommy: Here's the starring lady.
Nancy: What?
[Steve clicks tongue] 
Jonathan: See, you can tell that he knows it was wrong, but... Man, that's the thing about perverts... It's hardwired into 'em. You know, they just can't help themselves.
[rips the photos up]
[Tommy laughs]
Steve: So... we'll just have to take away his toy.
Nancy: Steve...
Jonathan: No, please, not the camera. 
Steve: No, no, wait, wait...Tommy, Tommy.
[Tommy chuckles]
Steve: It's okay. Here you go, man
[Tommy laughing
Steve: Come on, let's go. The game's about to start.
Tommy: Boo. 
Carol: Bye. (walks off with Steve and Tommy)
[Nancy sees the picture of Barb and looks at Jonathan]
Steve: Hey, Nance! Come on.
[breathing heavily]
Eleven: Three-one-five. Three-one-five. Three-one-five.
[cat meows]
[cat growling]
[Eleven thinks back to when she was in the lab and Brenner had her try to kill a cat]
Mike: El! (panting) You okay?
[Eleven nods]
Mike: Hop on. We only have a few hours.
[Eleven gets on the bike and the kids bike away]
Carol: So, I told Mr. Mundy... "The solution of ten plus Y equals... blow me."
[Tommy laughing]
Steve: Bull, if you did that, you'd be in detention right now.
Carol: Saturday.
Tommy: I bet Mr. Mundy's still a virgin.
Carol: Oh, he's so a virgin!
Tommy: Maybe you should blow him, Carol. Help your grades a bit.
[chuckling]
[Nancy starts walking off]
Steve: Whoa, Nance, where you going?
Nancy: I totally forgot. I told my mom I would, um... I would do something with her
Steve: Well, what do you mean? The game's about to start.
Nancy: I'm sorry.
Steve: (sighs) What the hell's wrong with her?
Tommy: Maybe she freaked out when you went all psycho on the psycho.
Steve: Oh, give me a break.
Carol: What'd you expect, dating Miss Perfect?
Eleven: Why did they hurt you?
Mike: What? Oh, that. Uh... I just fell at recess.
Eleven: Mike...
Mike; Yeah?
Eleven: Friends tell the truth.
[Mike sighs]
Mike: I was tripped by this mouth breather, Troy, okay?
Eleven: Mouth breather?
Mike: Yeah, you know... a dumb person. A knucklehead. 
Eleven: Knucklehead?
Mike: I don't know why I just didn't tell you. Everyone at school knows. I just didn't want you to think I was such a wastoid, you know?
Eleven: Mike...
Mike: Yeah?
Eleven: I understand.
Mike: Oh. Okay, cool. Cool.
[Nancy is looking in Barb's car for her]
Nancy: Barb? Barb! 
[Nancy heads into the Harringtons' back yard] 
Nancy: Barb?
[rustling]
Nancy: Barb?
[rustling]
Nancy: Barb?
[growling]
[Nancy falls and runs away]
[porch swing creaking]
[dog whines]
[Joyce is inside, smoking. The xmas lights turn on]
[Joyce follows them into a small cupboard and grabs some lights]
Joyce: Will... are you here? 
[lights flicker]
Joyce: Okay, good, good, good, good. Are you... Um, blink once for yes, twice for no. Can you do that for me, sweetie? Can you do...
[lights blink once]
Joyce: Oh, good boy. Good boy. Baby, I need to know... Are you alive?
[lights blink once]
Joyce: Are you safe?
[lights blink twice]
Joyce: I need to know where to find you, honey. Where... where are you? Can you... can you tell me where you are? Can you...  Please, baby. I need to find you. Tell me what to do. Please just... Will...
[Joyce sniffling]
[Joyce then paints the alphabet on the wall under the xmas lights]
[Nancy walks inside and heads to Karen]
Karen: Hey! You're home early! How was the game? Nancy? What's the matter?
Nancy: (crying) It's Barb. I think... something happened. (sniffles) Something terrible.
Powell: I don't know, Chief.
Hopper: What don't you know?
Hopper: Okay, forget about her. Take a look at this. Dr. Martin Brenner.
Powell: Who?
Hopper: Brenner. He runs Hawkins Lab. 
Powell: Okay.
Hopper;  You don't find that interesting?
Powell: Not really. He was involved in some hippie crap back in the day, so what?
Hopper: No, this isn't hippie crap. This is CIA-sanctioned research.
Hopper: Come on. Look at that. Hospital gowns. All of 'em. Now, that piece of fabric that the teacher found by the pipe. That sure looked like a hospital gown to me, huh? Am I wrong?
Powell: I don't know, Chief.
Hopper: Come on, man. Work with me here. I'm not saying that there's some grand conspiracy. I'm just... I'm saying maybe something happened. Maybe Will was in the wrong place at the wrong time and he saw something that he shouldn't have.
Powell: It's a reach.
Hopper: It's a start.
Callahan: (on the radio) Hey, Powell, is the chief with you?
Hopper: Hopper here. What do you got?
[Hopper and Powell leave the library quickly]
Eleven: Here.
Mike: Yeah, this is where Will lives.
Eleven: Hiding.
Mike: No, no, this is where he lives. He's missing from here. Understand?
Lucas: What are we doing here?
Mike: She said he's hiding here.
Lucas: Um... no!
Lucas: That's exactly what we did. I told you she didn't know what the hell she was talking about!
Mike: Why did you bring us here?
Lucas: Mike, don't waste your time with her.
Mike: What do you want to do then?
Lucas: Call the cops, like we should have done yesterday.
Mike: We are not calling the cops!
Dustin: Hey, guys?
Lucas: What other choice do we have?
Dustin: Guys!
[sirens approaching]
Mike: Will...
[they follow the sirens on their bikes]
[Joyce finishes painting the alphabet on the wall]
Joyce: Okay, baby, talk to me. Talk to me. Where are you? "R." Good, good, good, good. That's good. Come on, come on. "I"... "G"... "H"... "T"... "H"... "E"... "R"... "E"... "Right here." "Right here"? I don't know what that means. I need you to tell me what to do. What should I do? How do I get to you? How do I find you? What should I do?
[Joyce whimpers]
[monster screeching]
[demogorgon rips through the wall]
Hopper: (gets out the car) Oh, Jesus. Oh, God. Please tell me it's not the kid.
[the kids arrive on their bikes] 
Mike: It's not Will. It can't be.
Lucas: It's Will. It's really Will.
Eleven: Mike...
Mike: "Mike"? "Mike," what? You were supposed to help us find him alive. You said he was alive! Why did you lie to us? What's wrong with you? What is wrong with you?
Eleven: Mike...
Mike: What?
Lucas: Mike, come on. Don't do this, man. Mike...
Dustin: Mike, where are you going? Mike!
Lucas: Mike!
[Mike bikes away]
[Joyce is running away from the house]
[Jonathan stops his car in front of her]
Jonathan: Mom? Mom, what happened?
[Joyce whimpers]
Jonathan: It's okay. Hey.
[Mike arrives home]
Karen: Michael? What's wrong?
[Mike sobs]
