We talked about you pretty much every day. 
What? 
Oh. You like these pearls? [purrs] 
Demo-dogs. 
It's not. I'm sorry.
Yeah, somewhere far away. 
All right. [sighs] It should fit now. 
What am I supposed to do? 
All right, I got the door. 
Demo-dogs!
That's one point of view.
The mind flayer would call away his army. 
[exclaims] Shit! Did he see us? 
[chuckles] 
Yes! Kick his ass, Steve! 
Murder the son of a bitch! 
Now! Now!
Kill the son of a bitch!
Shit! 
You're gonna kill him. 
Just relax. She's driven before. 
They were gonna leave you behind. 
I promised that you'd be cool, okay? 
Whoa! 
You're pretty sure, or you're certain? 
Shit! 
Hang on. Wait, wait. [he catches up with them]
Light her up.
Oh, my God. Oh, my God. 
Steve, pull him out. 
You okay? 
Dart.
Shh. Stop. 
I've got our favorite. See? Nougat. 
There's plenty. I've got more. [he puts down more]
[looks back at Dart as he’s leaving] Goodbye, buddy.
Come on, Mike! Move, Mike! 
[screams as the demo-dogs run at him and Steve] No! 
This is...
Son of a bitch! Son of a bitch! 
Right here, where I put it. 
[finds the paper bag he was looking for] Got it. 
[exhales] Okay.
Pretend like I don't care. 
I don't care. 
What? 
Yeah. 
Yeah.
Like a lion. [purrs]
Okay. 
Thank you, my lord. 
Hey, Nance.
What do you mean, "What happened"? 
[clears throat] Stacy. 
[clears throat] Stacy. 
[clears throat and offers his hand] Shall we? 
Hey. [he wipes his eyes]
What? 
Good? 
Okay. 
[grins] Really? 
You think so? 
I don't know
Shit!
You guys all right back there?
They're fine.
Come on. We gotta go, now.
Let's go! [pulls them both out with Erica]
Here goes nothin'.
Why would they be drunk?
He's burning up.
One sec, one sec. Steve, Steve.
His pupils are super dilated.
Steve, are you drugged?
This isn't funny, okay? I need to know what they did to you. Are you gonna die on us?
They're gonna be looking for us up there, so I need you to tell me where you parked your car.
All right. Yeah, food. Yes, you can have as much food as you want, but only if you tell me where your car is parked.
Uh-oh?
What?
Shit! Come on! Come on!
Just trust me.
All clear.
Come on.
You two, sit.
Then don't watch the movie.
Then watch it!
Sorry. Whatever you do, don't... go... anywhere.
Sorry. Sorry.
Okay, it's official. I'm never having kids.
We're laying low. Cooling off. Like Oswald.
A week later. 
Only because it was a setup.
He was just a patsy.
Shh!
All right, you watch Tweedledee and Tweedledum. Make sure they don't go anywhere.
To find us a ride.
[distorted via radio] I repeat... this is a code red!
Mike?
Mike! Oh, my God, you have to listen. I know I've been MIA, and I'm sorry, it's not because I'm mad. I mean, I actually was mad, but it's also because I was trapped underground in a secret Russian base.
I know that sounds insane, but the Russians have infiltrated Hawkins! The goddamn Russians! And now- they're using- to open the gate.
And now they're after us and we don't have a way out of here, so I need you to come and get us. Can Nancy drive?
Mike?
Mike? Mike, do you copy?
Shit! Not now. Please, not now. Mike!
Mike!
Do you have any batteries? Double-A?
I always carry batteries.
I need eight.
Shit. Guess we'll have to go to plan B.
Where... are they?
Okay. What the hell?
And... blend.
Course it worked. We just have to get on the bus with the rest of these plebes, and home sweet home, here we come.
What?
Why?
What is wrong with you?
So?
So, you resist. You tough it out. You tough it out like a man.
Abort.
Abort. Abort.
[laughing] You flung that thing like a Hot Wheel!
El has superpowers.
She cracked the top secret code.
Didn't you hear our code red?
Goddamn low battery.
Well, everything worked out, didn't it?
Yeah, but we didn't, did we?
What are you not comprehending? Am I not speaking English? We have a full-blown Red Dawn situation.
 It has everything to do with the gate...
Will!
Mrs. Byers?
Morning, Dart. Got you some breakfast. Your favorite. 
I gotta go to school, but I'll be back soon. Sound good?
What the hell's going on?
Jesus!
Hi, Max.
Where's Will?
Come on, Mike.
Sorry.
So that's why he was frozen like that?
Well, if you're in another plane, you can't interact with the material plane, so theoretically, no, the shadow can't hurt him.
Dart? What's he gotta do with this?
Hi, hey. Hey, Mom.
Yeah, everything's fine. Yeah.
Dart, I've gotta talk to you, buddy. It's about my friend, Will. [panting] I think...
What the hell?
Dart?
You're gonna take out the Demogorgon with a slingshot?
Well, alrighty. So, we've got... Nutty Bars, Bazooka, Pez, Smarties, Pringles, Nilla Wafers, apple, banana, and trail mix.
With her mind! Are you kidding me? That's insane! Imagine all the other cool stuff she could do. Like... I bet... that she could make this fly! Hey. Hey. Okay, concentrate. Okay? 
Okay, one more time. Okay. (sighs) Use your powers, okay?
Too big for the sling. So, do you think Eleven was born with her powers, like the X-Men,or do you think she acquired them, like... like Green Lantern?
That's not funny. It's serious. He's in danger.
(picks up a rock) Hey. How about this one?
Yeah?
Hey, guys?
Guys!
Mike, where are you going? Mike!
What if it's the Demogorgon? Oh, Jesus, we're so screwed if it's the Demogorgon.
Troglodytes?
We're in deep shit.
Too risky. Cast a protection spell.
Cast Protection!
Cast Protection!
Is it a 13?
Oh, my God!
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!
Yo, hey guys. Does anyone want this?
Hey, Nancy. There's a slice left if you want it. Sausage and pepperoni!
There's something wrong with your sister.
She's got a stick up her butt.
Yeah, she's turning into a real jerk.
Nuh-uh, she used to be cool. Like that time she dressed up as an elf for our elder tree campaign.
Just saying.
Kiss your mom 'night for me. Race you back to my place? Winner gets a comic.
Yeah. Hey! Hey! I didn't say "go"! Get back here! I'm gonna kill you!
Son of a bitch.
Yeah, he's always paranoid Gursky's gonna give him another pop quiz.
I told you a million times, my teeth are coming in. It's called cleidocranial dysplasia.
Yeah, except I can't fight evil with it.
I bet you can talk to New York on this thing.
(Australian accent) Hello, this is Dustin, and this is the secretary and treasurer of Hawkins Middle AV Club. Do you eat kangaroos for breakfast?
Well, <i>The Hobbit</i>.
He asked!
Yeah.
<i>The Hobbit</i>.
Hey!
Yes, sir.
Hey, guys. You feel that? I think maybe we should go back.
Hey, guys, wait up. Wait up!
I got your <i>X-Men 134! </i>Guys, I really think we should turn back.
I'm just being realistic, Lucas!
Did you ever think Will went missing because he ran into something bad? And we're going to the exact same spot where he was last seen? And we have no weapons or anything?
I'm just saying, does that seem smart to you?
They're probably just sucking face somewhere. 
Did they go with the chief?
Yeah, and we don't even know where your sister is.
Mike, look at her. I still think we should stick to the chief's plan.
Yeah, and she's kind of a badass now, so... 
I am. I'm just gonna go get some chocolate pudding! I'm telling you, Lunch Lady Phyllis hoards that shit.
El needs to be recharged! 
Found it! I knew she was hoarding it. I knew it.
Lando. 
She's just drained. 
That's right! 
No! No! Get off me! 
Get off me! 
Demogorgon. 
Oh, my God!
[stutters] Is... Is it dead? 
Get the wrist rocket! Get the wrist rocket now! 
Take it out now! 
Getting the rocks!
Come on! 
Fire! Fire! 
Kill it! Bastard!
Kill it now! 
Get, get, get... Come on, kill the bastard!
Get, get, get... Come on, kill it! 
Eleven! 
Move. 
It was mental.
Jennifer Hayes was crying. 
In front of the whole school!
Her name's Eleven. 
She's basically a wizard. 
And blood was pouring out of their faces. 
...shot out of the wall...
It's the thessalhydra, I'm telling you. 
I'm telling you, it's the thessalhydra. 
Damn it. 
Fireball the son of a bitch. 
Whoa. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, that's not it, is it? 
But it doesn't make any sense. 
Uh, no, what about the lost knight? 
Okay. 
Very mature, Lucas. 
Oh.
Shut up.
Bye, Will. 
[chuckles] Stop.
No, you stop. 
Yeah, scream! You're like a little girl.
Uh-huh.
Thank you so much, Mr. McCorkle. Thank you so much. You are a true lifesaver. All right, this was great.
Thank you. All right. Have a good one. Bye-bye, now. All right. You, too. [puts the phone down] All right, great news.
No. But they saw her wandering around Loch Nora.
I don't know. Lost, I guess. But they're gonna look for her. And I'll stay here, just in case they call again. And you're gonna go help look? Yeah? Yeah? Give me hug. G [he hugs her]ive me a hug. Go get her. You're gonna find her.
We can find her.
I love you.
I love you.
All right, go. All right.
All right, Dart. Breakfast time.
Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Shit. Shit. Shit. Shit. Shit. Shit. Shit. Shit. Shit. Shit. Shit. Shit. Shit. Shit. Shit. Shit. Shit.
Come on. Come on, I know you're hungry. [he spots Dart following the baloney trail] Yes. Yes, yes, yes.
Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes.
Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes.
Shit!
I'm sorry. You ate my cat.
Guys, this is Dustin again. Does anyone copy? This is a code red. I repeat, a code red! I really need someone to pick up here. Hopper's MIA, and I've got a code red. Code red! All right, it's Dustin again. Seriously, I have a code red.
Erica? Erica, is Lucas there? Where is he?
[stutters] Is he with Mike?
Please tell him it's super important. Please tell him that I have a code-
Yep, code red. Exactly.
[stutters] Erica?
Your line has been busy for over two hours, Mr. Wheeler. Do you realize this?
Is Mike home?
No? Well, where the hell is he?
[sighs] No one's picking up there. Nancy. What about Nancy?
Seriously?
Son of a bitch. You're really no help at all, you know that?
Steve.  Are those for Mr. or Mrs. Wheeler?
Good.
Nancy isn't home.
Doesn't matter. We have bigger problems than your love life. Do you still have that bat?
The one with the nails?
I'll explain it on the way.
Now!
Hi.
I'm Dustin.
Pleasure to meet you. Uh, is- is he here?
I'm back! You got the job!
Mm-hmm. Brilliant, too. And she doesn't even care that my real pearls are still coming in. She says kissing is better without teeth.
Hm. So do you really just get to eat as much of this as you want?
She seems cool.
They ditched me yesterday.
My first day back. Can you believe that shit?
They're gonna regret it, though, big time, when they don't get to share in my glory.
So, last night, we're trying to get in contact with Suzie...
Mm-hmm?
And, uh... [looks around at the patrons of Scoops Ahoy]
[whispers] I intercepted a secret Russian communication.
[clicks tongue] Uh... [inhales deeply] [softly] I intercepted a secret Russian communication.
[loudly] I intercepted a secret Russian communication!
It means, Steve, we could be heroes. True American heroes.
Mm-hmm?
Just think, you could have all the ladies you want and more.
More.
Mm-hmm.
No catch, I just need your help.
[gets out a Russian to English dictionary] Translation.
So what do you think?
What?
Why are you listening to the music, Steve? Listen to the Russian! We're translating Russian!
I guarantee you, what we're doing is way more important than your data.
How does she know about the Russians?
You told her about-
Russian?
Holy shit!
Uh...
Okay.
"Dly-nna-ya..."
D... D, D, D...
The- The chair. The chair-looking thingy.
Honestly, I think it's great news.
It's not nonsense. It's too specific. It's obviously a code.
Like a super secret spy code.
Exactly.
Exactly.
Exactly.
Evil Russians.
So how do we crack it?
A pattern. Right, like maybe "silver cat" is a meeting place?
Or a weapon.
Holy shit. The music. The music!
It's the exact same song on the recording.
It's not a lizard. 
How do I know if it's not a lizard? 
Because his face opened up and he ate my cat.
He's in there. 
It's not. 
It's not a prank. Get it out of my face.
Steve? Steve, what's going on down there? 
Oh, shit
Oh, shit! No way. No way. 
Well, well, well, look who it is. 
And bring your binoculars and wrist rocket. 
Just be there, stat. Over and out.
All right, that's grossly oversimplifying things.
An interdimensional slug? Because it's awesome. 
Even if you do? 
Then what? 
Feel what? 
Oh. 
So that's when you kiss her? 
Sorry. 
Mmm. 
What type is Nancy? 
Yeah, she seems pretty special, I guess. 
What? [they stop walking]
Uh, no. No.
I won't.
What? 
Damp. 
Farrah Fawcett spray? 
Yup.
Farrah Fawcett, really? 
Yeah.
You told her? 
"So what?" 
Are you suggesting that I'm lying? 
Yeah, that was before he turned into a Demogorgon. 
No. 
No. 
You probably didn't tell it right. 
All right, asshole! God! 
You see him? 
Lucas, what's going on? 
What's he doing?
Maybe he's not hungry? 
Steve? Steve, what are you doing? Steve? 
Expanding the menu. 
He's awesome. 
Steve, run! 
Shit! 
Shit! 
Is anyone there? Mike? Will? God! Anyone! 
Steve scared 'em off? 
Where's your hair? Do you have cancer?
I bet she's deaf.
Not deaf.
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
This is mental.
She tried to get naked.
She just went like...
You got a lot of family there?
Why she went like...
Like Micheal Myers.
I think we should tell your mom.
Oh, man.
You're letting a girl--
You really think she's psycho?
(sighs) Mental.
Oh, this is weird. He's never this late.
I thought you liked his plan.
If his mom found out a girl spent the night-
Hey, what if she slept naked?
Oh, if Mrs. Wheeler tells my parents...
I don't know.
What do you mean she knows about Will?
That is weird.
What kind of danger?
Mike, what kind of danger?
Me, too.
Mmm-mmm.
Sorry. Spasm.
We never would've upset you if we knew you had superpowers.
Ow!
You lend them your cool stuff, like comic books and trading cards.
Superpowers.
You see anything?
Evil Russians.
Tall, blond, not smiling.
Also, look for earpieces, camo, duffel bags, that sort of thing.
What?
If you're not gonna focus, just gimme the binoculars.
Dude, you are the worst spy in history, you know that?
Give me those. I don't get why you're looking at girls. You have the perfect one in front of you.
Robin.
Robin, Robin, Robin.
Robin. Robin. Robin.
Robin.
What's your type again? Not awesome?
Hm.
And she's in band?
Now that you're out of high school, which means you're technically an adult, don't you think it's time you move on from primitive constructs such as popularity?
Camp Know Where, actually. And no, it's shit I learned from life.
Instead of dating somebody you think's gonna make you cooler, why not date somebody you actually enjoy being around? Like me and Suzie.
Yeah, that Suzie.
Target acquired.
Ten o'clock. Sam Goody's.
Slow down.
You're getting too close.
[picks up a phone as the man turns around] [in monotone voice] Hello. Yes. I am fine. How are you?
You did too.
Yes, you did.
What if it's the Demogorgon? Oh, Jesus, we're so screwed if it's the Demogorgon.
They're with that whistling guy, ten o'clock.
Guns, bombs?
Whatever it is, they're armed to the teeth.
It's just more boxes.
No, I'm still looking.
Hang on!
Duck! [gasping]
[stammers] How was what?
Oh. Oh, yeah, it was... It was, uh, tubular.
Nothing.
No. What? No.
No. Mom!
I am not acting weird!
Whoa! Ah! [laughing nervously]
[laughs] Yeah.
Yep. One, two, three, four and five.
Are you shitting me?
Yes, my lord?
Please, yes.
Phineas Gage. 
104. 104.
His name is d'Artagnan. [picks him up] Cute, right? 
Dart for short.
Foraging for food. You wanna hold him? 
He doesn't bite. 
Then I've discovered a new species. 
What if he steals my discovery? 
This is the reason I was late for class.
I'm just trying to clarify-
Okay, fine. 
What the hell are you doing? 
Mike! 
Why didn't you tell us before? 
So it’s a coincidence. 
How can you say that? 
We have a bond. 
No, because he trusts me! 
Yes, I promised I would take care of him.
Don't hurt him. 
No! 
Why did you attack him? 
Don't hurt him. Don't you hurt him!
West is clear, too. Will? 
Where? 
Hey, buddy. Come here. You know I won't hurt you. 
It's okay. It's just me. You're okay. 
[hides Dart under his cap] Stay low. Keep quiet. 
I don't know. Not here. 
Yeah, maybe Will has him. 
Did you not hear the part about the massive gun? 
Twice. Jonathan. Year prior? 
Not bad. 
Air ducts. 
I'll fit. Trust me. No collar bones, remember? 
Steve, just shut up and push me! 
Not my feet, dumbass. Push my ass. 
Touch my butt! I don't care! 
Come on! Harder! Push harder! 
You're playing with my legs. 
Come on! 
Just shove me? 
Shit. 
One more time. 
You don't know if you can fit?
Yes, but he won't be there. 
Do this for America... Erica.
(offended) Yeah. 
No. 
No. 
No! No! If you die, I die.
Was that just me, or did the room move?
Which one do I press, Erica? 
Which one? I'm pressing the button, okay? 
I'm pressing "open door." 
I'm trying. 
[sighs] Empty and cold. Wait, did he say cold? 
[sighs] It's like riddles in the dark. 
No.
Like the Vale of Shadows. 
"The Vale of Shadows , , is a dimension that is a dark reflection or echo of our world. It is a place of decay and death."
"A plane out of phase. A place of monsters. It is right next to you, and you don't even see it."
You cast Shadow Walk.
We can't shadow walk, but... maybe she can. [he motions to El]
Just wait till we tell Will that Jennifer Hayes was crying at his funeral.
“Can you hear us? We're here!”
[munching]
Man, these aren't real Nilla Wafers. 
We were thinking of more of an evil dimension, like the Vale of Shadows. You know the Vale of Shadows?
Well, is there any way for the acrobat to get to the Upside Down? , ,
Like a gate?
I... I need to see your compasses.
Your compasses. All of your compasses, right now!
Well, they're all facing north, right?
Well, that's not true north.
I mean exactly what I just said. That's not true north. Are you both seriously this dense? The sun rises in the east, and it sets in the west. Right? Which means that's true north. 
[sighs] Do you even understand how a compass works? Do you see a battery pack on this?
No, you don't. Because it doesn't need one. The needle's naturally drawn to the Earth's magnetic North Pole.
Well, that's what I couldn't figure out, but then I remembered. You can change the direction of a compass with a magnet. If there's the presence of a more powerful magnetic field, the needle deflects to that power. And then I remembered what Mr. Clarke said. The gate would have so much power-
Exactly.
They should lead us to the gate.
I don't know. These only tell direction, not distance. You really need to learn more about compasses.
Uh, I think a portal to another dimension is gonna be pretty obvious.
You're asking if the weirdo is acting weird?
I don't know. Who cares?
Oh, no.
We're headed back home.
Yeah, I'm sure. Setting sun, right there. We looped right back around.
Why is this all on me?
What do yours say?
Makes no damn sense.
No, I don't think it's the gate. I think it's something else screwing with the compasses. , 
No, it has to be like a super magnet.
All right, calm down!
Knock it off, you idiots.
Mike, get off! 
Jesus! 
Lucas. Lucas, come on! 
Come on, Lucas! 
Come on.
Come on, wake up. Come on!
Lucas... Lucas, how many fingers am I holding up? Lucas, how many fingers?
Let him go. Man, let him go.
Eleven!
El!
All you need to know is it's bad. 
Shit. 
[screeching] Guards! Go! 
Shit! 
Come on! 
Go, come on, now! 
I won't forget you!
Yes, of course.
Yeah. 
Yes! 
Makes total sense. 
No. 
Yeah, no shit, Sherlock.
Yeah, with that attitude, they are. Jee-zus! 
Holy shit. You're a nerd. 
You... are... a... nerd. 
Can't put the truth back in the box. 
Fact number two: you're a political junkie.
Fact number three: you love My Little Pony. 
Because I'm...
a nerd. 
Let's go... nerd. 
Jackpot. 
Oh-ho-ho! 
How hard can it be? Max did it. 
Aw, come on. 
There's gotta be a spare.
Yeah?
Big. Nine feet or so. Why? 
Found 'em. Erica? 
What the hell is that?! 
For what? 
Get ready to run.
What?
I'm in range. They should be answering.
[sighs]
At least someone's happy I'm home.
It's just a dream. You're dreaming.
I would like you to meet... Cerebro.
An unassembled one-of-a-kind battery-powered radio tower.
Suzie with a z. She's from Utah.
Suzie does. She's a genius.
Think Phoebe Cates, only hotter.
Cerebro works best at a hundred meters.
Yeah, but Suzie's Mormon.
Yeah. Like Romeo and Juliet.
Star-crossed lovers.
We're almost there.
Curfew at 4:00?
Will, come on!
Made it.
Pretty impressive, right?
Now, you ready to meet my love?
Suzie, this is Dustin. Do you copy? Over.
I'm sure she's there. It's just-
You know, maybe she's, like, busy or-
It's around dinnertime.
Here. Suzie, do you copy? This is Dustin. Over.
Suzie, do you copy? This is Dustin. Over.
...do you copy? This is Dustin. Over.
Suzie! This is Dustin. Do you copy? Over.
Suzie, this is your Dustin. Do you copy? Over.
Suzie-
She's there, all right? She'll pick up.
She exists!
Where are you going?
Well... guess it's just you and me, Byers.
Yeah, sure.
[to himself] Yeah. Welcome home.
Shit. Shit. Suzie? Suzie, is that you?
Guys! It's Lucas, I think he's in trouble.
Do you remember how he said he was looking for the gate?
What if he found it?
I don't know, he's way out of range.
"Mad hen." Does that mean anything to you? Like a code name or something?
You don't think...
Mike! 
Mike! We need to leave... right now.
Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
Yeah, Lucas, they're on us.
Cornwallis.
Copy. Elm and Cherry!
Shit!
Out of the way! Out of the way!
I think we lost them.
Shit, shit, shit, shit, shit!
Holy... holy shit! Did... did you see what she did to that van?
I mean that was...
Well, who owns Hawkins Lab?
Department of Energy? What do you think that means?
Then why does it say "Energy"?
Do they make, like, lightbulbs or something?
Oh, Jesus, this is bad.
Well, what do we do?
Guys? Do you hear that?
Come on, come on! It's stuck. 
Go, go, go, go, go, go!
Mental.
You guys hear that?
Okay, this is really weird.
It's like Lando Calrissian. Don't answer.
How the hell does he know about...
It's been way too long. Do you know what? Maybe you're right. Maybe this is all a trap and the bad men are coming to get us right now!
Lando Calrissian.
I don't feel good about this. I don't feel good about this!
Shit!
Lando.
A gate.
With our compasses.
Okay, so the gate has a really strong electromagnetic field and that can change the directions of a compass needle.
How do you know all that?
The more energy she uses, the more tired she gets.
It was awesome.
Mr. Clarke? It's Dustin.
Yeah, yeah. I just, I... I have a science question.
Do you know anything about sensory deprivation tanks? Specifically how to build one?
Fun.
You always say we should never stop being curious. To always open any curiosity door we find.
Why are you keeping this curiosity door locked?
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh. How much? Uh-huh. Yep, all right. Yeah, we'll be careful. Definitely. All right, Mr. Clarke. Yeah, I'll see you on Monday. I'll see you on Monday, Mr. Clarke. Bye. Do you still have that kiddie pool we bobbed for apples in?
Good. Then we just need salt. Lots of it.
1,500 pounds.
This damn thing is heavy. 
Come on. It's upside down.
Okay, um... How does this even work?
Son of a bitch!
I am!
Shit!
♪ Who you gonna call? ♪
Guys... Guys! Guys! Why is no one else wearing costumes?
When do people make these decisions?
It's a conspiracy, I'm telling you.
We gonna do this?
Maybe she likes Ghostbusters?
I didn't bring regular clothes. You?
Then we have no choice. We gotta do this. It's now or never.
Let's engage.
We could ask her after class.
Okay.
[clears throat] Um... Hi, Max. I'm Dustin, and this is-
No, we were just concerned because, you know, you're new and all.
Mmm-hmm. There are a lot of bullies here.
Yeah.
Well, these don't function. But... I do have this handy-dandy little trap here. And look, it even opens and closes. Look, look, look... Voilà! [chuckles] It's cool, right? No? Okay. But, um... So, we were talking last night, and you're new here, so you probably don't have any friend to take you trick-or-treating, and you're scared of bullies, so we were thinking that it would be okay if you come with us.
Yeah. Our party's a democracy, the majority voted you could come.
We know where to get the full-sized candy bars. We figured you'd want in.
Yeah. Totally. Uh, so, um... you'll come?
We're meeting at the Maple Street cul-de-sac at 7:00. That's 7:00 on the dot! "Presumptuous." That's a good thing, right?
Is it bad? Lucas, is it bad? Lucas? Son of a bitch, Lucas. Is it bad?
Really, everyone dressed up last year.
Hey, guys?
Mike, you need to haul ass!
Whoa! Shit! Shit! Shit! Shit!
Holy shit! Was that...
Will! Hey!
Hey, don't cross the streams. Don't cross the streams!
Egon!
What's wrong with 3 Musketeers?
Whoa. "Just nougat"? Just nougat? It is top three for me.
Top three!
Seriously, I can just eat a whole bowl of nougat. Straight up.
Another full-size. Like, seriously, rich people are such suckers. Wait. You're not rich, right?
Oh.
Hmm. Yeah, totally tubular. What? Did I say that right? Or is it, like, tubular.
Totally tubular!
Totally brodacious, bro!
Holy shit!
All right, take it easy.
Mike?
Tubular. Tubular. Tubular.
Mews, is that-
Shit. Shit. Shit. Shit. [screams as he takes off the trash can lid]
Holy sh-
Jesus Christ.
Jesus Christ.
Jesus Christ.
Holy shit. Holy shit.
Oh, shit.
She's right. You're all gonna die, but you don't have to. Excuse me. Sorry, may I?
Okay, see this room here? This is a storage facility. There's a hatch in here that feeds into their underground ventilation system. That will lead you to the base of the weapon. It's a bit of a maze down there, but between me and Erica, we can show you the way.
Don't worry, you can do all the fighting and the dangerous hero shit, and we'll just be your... navigators.
Yep, most likely.
Barely. We could've really used you guys down there.
[hugs them] I missed you guys, too. Big-time.
It's not that simple.
Not with this. You need something with a high enough frequency band to relay with the Russians' radio tower. But for that to work, you need someone who has both seen their comms room and has access to a super-powered handcrafted radio tower, one preferably already situated at the highest point in Hawkins. Oh, wait. That's me. If you want us to navigate, you got us. But we need a head start. And a car.
Weathertop.
Just drive.
Relax, we're almost there.
I mean, nobody's scientifically perfect, but Suzie's about as close to being perfect as any human could possibly be.
Why are you hesitating, Steve?
Left. Turn left.
Turn left now!
Up!
[on radio] Bald Eagle, do you copy?
Bald Eagle, I repeat, this is Scoops Troop, do you copy?
Call sign?
Please repeat.
Copy that. Good to hear your voice, Bald Eagle. What's your 20?
Roger that, Bald Eagle. This is Scoops Troop, going radio silent. 10-10, over.
This is what?
All right, so if memory serves, this is right after the My Little Pony thesis.
Right. Fly right, Bald Eagle.
[on radio] Fly right.
Griswold Family, this is Scoops Troop! Do you copy? Over! Griswold Family, I repeat, this is Scoops Troop. Do you-
Griswold Family, do you copy? Do you copy?!
Griswold Family, this is Scoops Troop. Please confirm your safety! Griswold Family, this is Scoops Troop! Please confirm your safety! Are you en route to Bald Eagle's nest?
Please confirm your safety! Someone, please just answer. Is anyone there?
Just answer! Anyone, please...
[distorted transmission] Griswold Family, do you copy? Griswold Family, do you copy? 
Griswold Family, do you copy?
Do you copy?!
Wait, Robin! Stay in touch.
Bald Eagle, this is Scoops Troop. What's your 20?
Yeah, but we have a problem.
Planck's constant.
Not by heart. You?
Suzie, do you copy?
Suzie, do you copy? Suzie, do you copy?
Suzie!
I'm so, so sorry. I- I've been really busy... uh, trying to save the world from Russians and monsters.
[stammers] It was... Uh, I don't know, actually. I think it was just some interference. 
So, why don't we, uh, change frequency to 14.158?
I copy, Suzie-poo. It sounds much better now, thanks.
Okay, so, listen...
Do you know Planck's constant?
[snickers] Okay, so I know it starts with two sixes, and then a... W-What is it?
Suzie-poo, I promise, I will make it up to you as soon as possible.
What?
Not right now.
Suzie-poo, this is urgent.
Wait, wait, wait! Okay. Okay. Okay.
Shit. [sighs] ♪ Turn around ♪
♪ Look at what you see, In her face ♪
♪ The mirror of your dreams ♪
♪ Given in the light ♪
You just saved the world.
And I miss you more, Suzie-poo.
No, I miss you-
Hurry! Close it now!
[on radio] Close it!
Close it now! Close it!
Yeah, but you're butchering it, so could you please stop?
You guys are so funny, you should be on Carson.
No.
No. No way. It's reserved for Suzie's ears and Suzie's ears alone.
Shut up, you guys.
Stop! You guys, please, shut up.
She's gotta be close.
Mike, calm down.
Mike, this isn't your fault.
It wasn't his fault, either.
No.
Totally, but so were you!
And so was Eleven.
No, Mike, you give me a break! All three of you were being a bunch of little assholes! I was the only reasonable one. But the bottom line is... you pushed first. And you know the rule. You draw first blood...
You're shaking his hand!
This isn't a discussion. This is the rule of law. Obey or be banished from the party. Do you wanna be banished?
Good. 
Where do you think? We're going to get Lucas. And then we're gonna find Eleven.
All right, accident or not... admit it, it was a little awesome.
Yeah, she threw you in the air with her mind!
This is weird without Lucas.
He's just jealous.
Sometimes, your total obliviousness just blows my mind. He's your best friend, right?
It's fine. I get it. I didn't get here until the fourth grade. He had the advantage of living next door. But none of that matters. What matters is that he is your best friend. And then this girl shows up and starts living in your basement, and all you ever want to do is pay attention to her.
Yes, it is. And you know it. And he knows it. But no one ever says anything until you both start punching and yelling at each other like goblins with intelligence scores of zero. Now everything's weird.
Yeah, right.
Says logic.
Okay.
You don't think...
El!
El! Eleven!
What?
Shit! Run, Mike!
Run! Come on!
Move, Mike! Mike, come on, run!
Cramp!
Shit!
Get off! Get off me!
Our friend has superpowers, and she squeezed your tiny bladder with her mind.
Stop! No!
Mike, don't do it. I don't need my baby teeth, Mike! Mike, seriously, don't!
Mike, don't do it! Seriously, don't do it, man! Seriously, don't!
Mike, don't!
Mike!
Holy shit.
Yeah, that's right! You better run! She's our friend and she's crazy! You come back here and she'll kill you! You hear me? She'll kill you, you sons of bitches! She'll kill you, you hear me?
Son of a bitch! Son of a bitch!
Another stupid penny!
Can I please check under your cushions?
Mom, please? It's an emergency!
Love you, Mom.
Lucas, you copy? I've got four quarters. What's your haul?
How?
Old Man Humphrey's got that kinda cash?
You call Mike.
Mike, do you copy? Mike, do you copy?
What are you doing on this channel?
Lucas and I have six bucks total. What's your haul?
What do you mean you don't know yet?
Oh, Jesus! I'm in unchartered territory here, guys.
I'm going! I'm going! I'm going! I'm going! I'm going!
Okay. Shut up. Shut up. Shut up! 
No. No. No! No! No! No! I hate this overpriced bullshit! Son of a bitch! Piece of shit!
Whatever. I'm still tops on Centipede and Dig Dug.
Sure about what?
You're kidding me. No, no, no. Move! Move! No, no, no, no, no. Hey, no! No! No!
Who is Mad Max?
Yeah, spill it, Keith.
No, don't get him the date. Know what? He's gonna spread his nasty-ass rash to your whole family.
Oh, I'm a wastoid? She wouldn't go on a date with you. You make, like, what? $2.50 an hour?
Gonna make fun of my hair?
She shows up at school the day after someone with her same name breaks our top score. I mean, you kidding me?
And plus she skateboards, so she's pretty awesome.
I don't have to. I mean, look at her. Shit, I've lost the target.
Got it. There we go.
"Stop spying on me, creeps."
Well, shit.
You guys think he's okay?
Still no sign?
Oh! Damn it. My mom's gonna murder me.
Oh, yeah, nice try. You just want me out of here so you can make your move.
That's right. She will not be able to resist these pearls.
Ten o'clock. Ten o'clock.
Oh, my God. I see that. I don't even know why you need those. God. You're so stupid.
She's...
Mike?
Yeah, it's me, Dustin. What're you doing on this channel again? I've been trying to reach you all day. We were right. Max is Mad Max.
But-
We stick to the plan.
Last time I checked, our party is not a dictatorship. It's a democracy.
How can Max say no to these? [purrs]
I'll see you tomorrow.
Mews! Mews.
[screeching] Shit! Shit! 
Why don't these buttons work?! 
What do you think I'm doing?! 
[screams] 
We're stuck in here. 
Hey. 
What if we climbed out? 
The mall just opened. 
So someone could be in range. 
I heard you guys talking all night. 
What are you doing?
Holy mother of God.
Why me?
It all comes into the mall like any old delivery.
Like a nuclear weapon? 
You think the Russians know? 
They could. 
Maybe. 
I don't know, but it's...
Walkie. 
Wherever that broadcast is coming from- 
It can reach the surface. 
Too close. 
Red Dawn.
Are you sure? 
That could be a hundred different things.
Dude! You did it! You won a fight!
Getting us our ticket out of here.
...but I guess you're- 
Holy shit.
Are you sure you're on the right channel? 
Like... like Professor X. 
I don't know, I mean... Do you remember when Will fell off his bike and broke his finger? He sounded a lot like that. 
Well, maybe it's his ghost. Maybe he's haunting us. 
Mr. Clarke's Heathkit ham shack. 
Wow. She looks-
Hey, do you think you can open it? With your powers?
Yeah, definitely upset.
To cry.
Second cousin.
Sweden!
She hates it there.
Subzero.
Abort.
Holy shit!
This is crazy.
Holy...
What is that?
Can you hear us? We're here!
You'd better run! She's our friend, and she's crazy!
Yes. He had the same exact yellow pattern on his butt.
Well, he's molted three times already.
Molted. Shed his skin to make room for growth like hornworms.
It's gotta be soon. When he does, he'll be fully grown, or close to it. And so will his friends.
No, what? No. What are you talking about?
Steve!
No! No. No, I... No, I... He missed me. He wanted to come home.
I didn't know he was a Demogorgon, okay?
So did you!
You told a stranger the truth!
But I didn't, Lucas, okay?
I didn't tell her! We both broke the rule of law, okay? So we're even. We're even.
That was not my fault!
He wasn't gonna eat us.
I don't see him.
Jonathan.
They're not in there, are they?
I haven't seen him since...
Let me try.
Let me try, Jonathan! 
Son of a bitch! You know what...
Hey! I got it! [chuckles] I got it!
They didn't believe you, did they?
What do you want to do, Mike? The Chief's right on this. We can't stop those Demo-dogs on our own.
Demogorgon dogs. Demo-dogs. It's like a compound. It's like a play on words-
I mean, when it was just Dart, maybe...
Precisely.
The shadow monster.
A collective consciousness. It's a super-organism.
Like the mind flayer.
The mind flayer.
It's a monster from an unknown dimension. It's so ancient that it doesn't even know its true home. Okay, it enslaves races of other dimensions by taking over their brains using its highly-developed psionic powers.
No, it's a manual. And it's not for kids. nd unless you know something that we don't, this is the best metaphor-
Analogy? That's what you're worried about? Fine. An analogy for understanding whatever the hell this is.
Flayer. Mind flayer.
To conquer us, basically. It believes it's the master race.
Uh, the Nazis?
Uh... If the Nazis were from another dimension, totally. Uh, it views other races, like us, as inferior to itself. It wants to spread, take over other dimensions.
We win.
[chuckles] No. No, no Fire- No Fireballs. Uh, you summon an undead army, uh, because... [stammering] ...because zombies, you know, they don't have brains, and the mind flayer, it... it... It likes brains. It's just a game. It's a game.
I thought we were waiting for your military backup.
And we know that it's only a matter of time before those tunnels reach this town.
Hey. I'm... I'm sorry about Dart and all. I guess I just thought that he was my friend. I was wrong. I broke the rule of law, so if you want your girlfriend to take over my spot in the party, I understand.
I saw you two holding hands in the bus, Lucas.
Maybe, but I could feel it.
The electricity.
What happened?
Dash, dot, dash, dot.
Shit. Shit.
That's not good.
Holy shit.
