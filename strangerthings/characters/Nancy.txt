If this is a virus, and Will's the host, then... 
So if he likes it cold... 
What? 
No, I'm... [scoffs] I'm not just gonna leave Mike. 
Steve... 
It's actually kinda nice. 
Wait, Jonathan, Jonathan! His neck! His neck!
Hey. 
Hey. 
Wanna dance? 
That's good. Yeah.
Yeah. [chuckles] 
Oh, I know so. [chuckles] 
He must be.
Do you guys hear that? [shudders]
Hey, get away from the windows.
Go, go, go!
Go!
Go, come on!
[repeating] Come on!
Okay, get her down. Okay. Lemme see.
I'm cleaning the wound.
Yeah, okay.
What did that thing look like to you?
Yeah, a lot bigger. Like, Tom and Bruce, they merged to become one, right? And- And Driscoll kept saying how she needed to go back to the source-
Maybe. And- And- And maybe Heather and Janet, too, and God knows who else. I don't know how we're gonna kill this thing, but if we do-
And... we end this. Maybe. All I know is... we need El.
[runs over with Jonathan] What is it?
Yeah, we just have to shut it again.
I'm sorry, who are you?
Okay.
Hey, Mom, I was thinking about staying the night at Stacey's tonight? We were gonna have a girl's night. Romantic comedies, do our nails, gossip... 
Toast? No?
Hey. Did you see your mom?
You don't have to do this, you know.
It's 15 past.
That guy. There.
He just... just talked to himself.
I think we should go.
Jonathan.
Hey! Hey, assholes! Let us out of here!
Mistakes?
You killed Barbara.
You mean without us shutting up?
Mistakes?
Let's burn that lab to the ground.
(pulls away from Steve)
Nothing.
(puts on Steve's sweatshirt) Steve? Hey, Steve.
I'll... see you tomorrow, okay?
Oh! Jesus, you scared me.
I know, I should have called.
After the assembly, some people wanted to get something to eat. I didn't think it'd be a big deal.
I didn't realize how late it was, okay? I'm sorry, Mom. What more do you want? 
Steve's.
What?
Nothing happened.
Nothing happened. Can I please go?
(laughs nervously) Hey!
Yeah! Yeah, totally. I just... I feel like everyone's... staring at me.
I know. I know. Of course not. But what about, like, Tommy, and Carol and them?
I'm sorry
Yeah. Yeah. Me, too.
Hey, Ally. Where's Barb?
You haven't seen her anywhere... at all?
Hey, Tommy. When you left, did you see Barb?
Barbara. She's not here today.
Yeah. Yeah, probably.
Come on, come on, come on...
Hi. Hi, uh, Ms. Holland, it's Nancy.
Good. I'm good. Um, I was just wondering, uh, is Barb there?
But she did come home, right? After the vigil?
Right, yes. She did, sorry. I meant, did she come home this morning? I think she left some textbooks and she was gonna go pick them up.
Do- Do you know what? I just remembered... she's at the library.
Yeah. Yeah, I will. Sorry to bother you.
What's going on?
What?
Steve...
I totally forgot. I told my mom I would, um... I would do something with her
I'm sorry.
Barb? Barb! 
Barb?
Barb?
Barb?
(crying) It's Barb. I think... something happened. (sniffles) Something terrible.
Yeah. No, I don't think... Yeah, he's cute. Barb, no, I don't think so. Barb, you're not--
Hold on.
That's disgusting.
What the hell, Mike?
Are you kidding?
Keep your voice down.
I told you, it's not like that. Okay, I mean, yes he likes me, but not like that. We just...made out a couple times.
No, I'm not.
Oh, that's gross! Okay, I'm telling you, it was a one-time... Two-time thing.
Steve...
I have to go.
Steve. I really, like... Seriously, I have to go.
Uh... No, I can't. I have to study for Kaminsky's test.
Kaminsky's tests are impossible.
You failed chem.
Well, in that case...
Are you crazy? My mom would not--
You are crazy.
Steve... I have to study. I'm not kidding.
You're an idiot, Steve Harrington.
Meet me at Dearborn and Maple at 8:00. To study.
So... me and Barbara are gonna study at her house tonight. That's cool, right?
What? Why not?
This is such bullshit.
So we're under house arrest? Just because Mike's friend got lost on the way home from...
No!
You are such a douchebag, Mike!
(whispers) What are you doing here? I told you on the phone, I'm under house arrest now.
No. No way.
Starch and cellulose.
Tetrahedrons.
You said you wanted to help.
Uh, pass.
No.
No.
Melting point.
That's what I meant.
No.
No. (whispers) Steve. Steve, come on.
Are you crazy? My parents are here.
Was this your plan all along? To... to get in my room and then... get another notch on your belt.
I'm not Laurie, or Amy, or Becky.
That's not what I'm saying.
Shut up.
You're an idiot, Steve Harrington.
Straight into Will's room. And-
Wait for the yo-yo to move.
Ready. 
Jonathan, stop talking.
Three.
Did you hear that? 
Speak? 
Is that too tight? 
Steve, listen to me. 
You need to leave. 
I don't care about that. You need to leave. 
Nothing. [stutters] It was an accident. 
Nothing. 
No. 
[pulls the gun on Steve] Steve, get out!
You have five seconds to get out of here. 
I'm doing this for you. 
Three. Two. 
Where is it? 
Where is it? 
What's it doing? 
Do you hear anything? 
Where is it? 
No. Where-
Jonathan! 
Jonathan! Jonathan! 
Steve! 
Where did it go? 
Where's it going? 
Yeah. [they cuddle up on the sofa together]
We'd like a... uh, a room.
Hmm.
Nothing. Just... déjà vu. [chuckles softly]
Don't you think it's weird?
How we only seem to hang out when the world's about to end?
Feels like it. [sighs]
Still have yours?
Mmm... Yeah, mine's bigger.
Thanks.
What happened?
To us? After everything, you just... disappeared.
I waited.
I want them off.
"3833." Yeah.
Timeline's wrong.
Your timeline is wrong. And the girl with the buzzed hair, she's not Russian. She's from Hawkins Lab. Her name was Eleven.
So, is it enough? The tape recording, is it enough? [stutters] Is it incriminating?
What are you doing?
With vodka?
Music? Really?
How long is this gonna take?
Is the tape incriminating or not? It's a simple question.
Them?
That's why we made the tape.
He admits it. You heard it. He admits culpability.
You're saying we did all of this for nothing?
What's it?
We water it down.
 A leak from the lab. Like Three Mile Island or something.
And those assholes that killed Barb...
Oh, shit, shit.
And here you are, two creams, two sugars.
Of course. Tom?
I really hate to ask this, but do you think one of the other girls could run and grab lunch today? 
I know, I just, um... I really need to go to the doctor. I've been having some... um... girl problems.
Let's go.
Really? Because I feel like it's the best idea I've had all summer. 
The harm in asking is that Tom will say no. We ask for forgiveness, not permission. And if this story's as good as I think it's gonna be, then Tom won't care. In fact, he'll thank us.
And then we never have to work at this shithole again.
Mrs. Driscoll?
Hi, um, I'm Nancy. Nancy Wheeler. We spoke briefly on the phone last night.
We get that a lot.
Oh, it's... it's lovely. Um, do you live here all alone?
Oh, um... I'm... I'm so sorry.
And... these bags, um... you're sure they were full before?
Are you sure they did? Maybe they just gnawed the bag? I mean... eating fertilizer seems-
What does that mean, exactly... "not right"?
No, uh, rabid rats. Rats with rabies? Okay, um... What about just rats, in general? Uh-huh. Okay. Thank you.
Sure, thanks. Um... Do you mind if I make just a few more calls?
Jonathan! I have a lead.
Yeah, no shit. Come on.
Oh, no, no, no. We... we can't. 
Our parents... 
Well, it is pretty late. 
Friends. [chuckles] 
It's not a lie. 
An asshole. 
Yes. [chuckles] 
What? [stammering] No, we... I mean, I do. 
Afraid. 
Retreat? I don't retreat. 
Oh. Hey. 
I just, uh... I... I just wanted to say that... 
Wasted. [sighs] 
Uh... So, uh, good night, I guess. 
Mmm-hmm. Yeah, I'll be home real soon. 
Do you wanna try again? 
Yeah, I'm sure. 
Got it. Thank you for everything.
What... What is all of this? 
What? 
Slow down, Mike. That's disgusting.
Yeah, actually, I did.
Nothing.
Unoccupied space.
Steve-
In for what?
A party?
It's Tuesday
Um...
Should we say something?
Hey.
I just... I wanted to say, you know, um... I'm sorry about everything. Everyone's thinking about you... It sucks.
I'm sure he's fine. He's a smart kid.
I have to go. (chuckles) Chemistry test.
Good luck.
Because I don't want to go by myself. Barb... Barb, it's not rocket science. You just tell your parents you're gonna stay at my place afterwards. No, tell them we're... studying.
Coming! Look, I gotta go. I'll see you in an hour.
So, there's this... special assembly thing tonight.. for Will at the school field. Barb's driving.
I thought you knew.
I know, I know, but it'd be super weird if I'm not there. I mean, everyone's going.
Barbara, pull over.
Pull over!
We can't park in the driveway.
Yeah, the neighbors might see.
Calm down, Barb. Come on. You promised that you'd go. You're coming. We're gonna have a great time.
No, he doesn't.
Tommy H. and Carol are gonna be there.
Gross.
No. (changes)
Barb, chill.
Is that supposed to impress me?
You are a cliché, you do realize that?
(laughing) I'm so not in band.
Okay.
I got it.
Barb, you wanna try?
Come on.
It's fun! Just give it a-
Just... Just give it a shot.
Are you okay?
Barb, you're bleeding.
Yeah.
Nowhere. Just... upstairs. To change. I... fell in the pool. 
Why don't you go ahead and go home. I'll just... I'll get a ride or something.
Barb... I'm fine.
I'm fine. Just... go ahead and go home, okay?
Thanks. Um... some privacy, maybe
Steve?
Shut up.
[chuckles] You really are your mother's son, you know that?
It means... you worry too much.
I got this, okay?
No. No, see, that's the thing. I mean, listen, I thought she was crazy too, but-
But, it turns out, she's not alone. Blackburn's Supply, Hawkins Farming, the Crawleys, they've all had some supplies go missing, all in the past few days. And it's not just fertilizer. It's pesticides, cleaning supplies, diesel fuel. And that's just from one day of calling around. I mean... there's gotta be more.
I know how it sounds, but-
Ah...
Okay.
Proof.
They said they wanted proof, right? So let's give it to 'em.
No, the real rat. Driscoll's rat. You said yourself it looked sick. We can take it to an animal control center, they can run some blood tests on it, figure out what's wrong with it-
That's because he didn't believe us.
I'm right.
Then what's the point?
Oh, it's stupid?
No one's going to fire us. Look, if you don't want to go, that's fine. Just... give me the keys.
Mrs. Driscoll?
She's an 80-year-old woman and it's pouring. Where else would she be? [opens the door]
Maybe she fell. Or something.
Mrs. Driscoll?
Mrs. Driscoll?
It's Nancy. From The Hawkins Post.
Mrs. Driscoll?
Mrs. Driscoll?
Steve? 
Wha... What are you talking about? 
Yes. 
I don't understand. 
What? 
I was drunk, Steve. I don't remember any of that. 
Yes. 
Tell you what? 
Really? 
So, he asked you to take me home? 
Yeah, but it's different for you. Will came home. 
Do you really believe that?
Your mom's boyfriend. He works at RadioShack, right? 
Do you wanna skip fourth period?
Oh, uh, yeah. My Walkman broke. 
Anyway, we should go. It's a really big test. 
So... 
Very. 
No. [she calls Barb’s parents]
Mrs. Holland. Hi, it's, um... it's Nancy. 
I just need you to trust me. Please. 
Tom, if you just- 
I didn't know that. 
That's crazy. 
Oh, is this funny to you? 
Incredible? 
What's that supposed to mean?
[scoffs] 
It's a summer job. Your life is hardly over. 
God, here comes the Oliver Twist routine. 
I didn't realize I lived in a bubble! 
Is that what that was? That was humiliating. Humiliating.
You don't know what it's like. 
Yeah. Light day. 
Just a kid who has no idea what she's doing. 
I know. 
Dad. 
No. I get it from you, Mom. I get it from you. 
Proud of me for getting fired? 
Mom! 
[chuckles, sniffles] 
That would be... pretty amazing. 
Finish it.
Hi. 
Oh, my God.
I'm fine. Thanks.
Steve's house.
It's all so close.
You want to go out there.
I found something. And if we do see it... then what?
What are you doing?
Are you serious?
This is a terrible idea.
Your mom would.
She deserves to know.
[exhales] What are you doing here?
Nothing.
What? No. Oh, no, I was just... thinking about joining softball.
Yeah, you were. [sighs] Did you get in trouble with your parents?
No..
[chuckles] Yeah, I know..
I just, I... I don't think I can. I've been really busy with this whole funeral thing and... [inhales] with my brother. It's been really hard on him. 
So...
Sorry. I'll call you later. Is that okay? [she kisses his cheek – he turns and walks away]
You're supposed to hit the cans, right? 
Ah. 
[scoffs] Have you met my parents?
A rabbit?
Jesus.
[chuckles] I meant your dad.
I don't think my parents ever loved each other.
My mom was young. My dad was older, but he had a cushy job, money, came from a good family. So they bought a nice house at the end of the cul-de-sac... and started their nuclear family.
Yeah. Screw that. [she shoots and hits a can on the first try]
You never said what I was saying.
Yesterday. You said I was saying something and that's why you took my picture.
That is such bullshit.
I am not trying to be someone else. Just because I'm dating Steve and you don't like him
He's actually a good guy.
Yesterday, with the camera... He's not like that at all. He was just being protective.
Oh, and I guess what you did was okay? 
He had every right to be pissed
No.
You know, I was actually starting to think that you were okay.
Yeah. Yeah, I was thinking, "Jonathan Byers, maybe he's not the pretentious creep everyone says he is."
Oh.
Shut up.
I heard something.
Oh, God.
It's been hit by a car. We can't just leave it.
I thought you said- 
What was that?
Where'd it go?
No.
Jonathan? [when she gets no reply she goes through the opening, her flashlight immediately flickers]
Shit.
Damn!
Oh, my God. 
Jonathan... 
Jonathan! 
[sighs] Who's next? 
It doesn't make sense. 
El dumped you? 
And El's not stupid. 
She knows her abilities better than any of us. 
And she is her own person. 
With her own free will. 
Seriously, Mike? 
Found who?
And that's not normal, right? 
That's close. 
Shit!
Shit, shit, shit, shit, shit!
It's almost 9:00.
Can you please drive faster?
I'm serious, Jonathan, I can't be late.
For you. For you.
Welcome.
Sorry.
What about Starcourt?
Sorry.
Shit, shit.
Hawkins Post.
Um, hold on, I'm...
I'm sorry, can you... can you repeat that?
It's just a theory.
I have to go home.
Let go. Let go!
Mike is over there-
For Mike?
No, I don't.
I don't know. We haven't talked a lot. I mean, lately... 
I don't know.
Whoa.
Mike, are you there? Mike?
Mike, it's me, Nancy. Mike, are you there? Answer. Mike, we need you to answer.
This is an emergency, Mike. Do you copy? Mike, do you copy?
I need you to answer.
We need to know that you're there, Mike.
Mike. Oh, my God. Mike! 
I was so worried about you.
Is that my dress?
And my friend Barbara? Can you find her, too?
Well, how long?
Well, where are we gonna get that much salt?
Stand back.
What did she even eat?
Eleven.
I knew you were acting weird. I just... I thought it was because of Will.
Hey... No more secrets, okay? From now on we tell each other everything.
What? No. No, it's... it's not... it's not like that. Do you like Eleven?
What's going on?
Is Barb okay? Is she okay?
We have to go back to the station.
Your mom and Hopper are just walking in there like bait. That thing is still in there. And we can't just sit here and let it get them, too. We can't.
I wanna finish what we started. I want to kill it.
Barb, just go ahead and go home, okay?
I can't keep doing this.
Pretending like everything's okay.
Barbara. It's like everyone forgot. It's like nobody cares. Except her parents. And now they're selling their house.
And they're going to spend the rest of their lives looking for her.
It's destroying them.
Yeah, we could tell them the truth.
We don't have to tell them everything. 
Okay.
What's in this?
We're just being stupid teenagers for the night. Wasn't that the deal?
Get off.
Screw you!
No!
Steve! Stop. Stop. Stop.
What the hell?
It's coming.
[slurring] You wanted this.
It's bullshit. Bullshit.
No, you. You're bullshit.
You're pretending like everything is okay. You know, like we didn't... like we didn't kill Barb. Like, it's great. Like, we're in love and we're partying. Yeah, let's party, huh? Party. We're partying. This is bullshit.
It's bullshit.
It's bullshit.
[grabs his arm] Jonathan? [falls asleep]
Jonathan!
And it almost did. That was just one tiny piece of it.
Yes.
Yes, exactly.
I don't... I don't know.
You can't be serious. Come on!
Yes. I'm sure it's fine.
No.
Yes!
Come on!
What?
Back in the mall! Back in the mall! Go! Go, go, go!
Go! Go!
This is just a precaution, okay?
No chance that thing'll drive, right?
How do we get it open?
I don't know, hold on.
Do you see it?
What are you doing?
Get the car started. Go!
Get in!
What?
Hit me.
Sorry. Sorry. Still got it?
Is that... everything?
You could stay in our basement.
We could hide you in a tent, like El.
So what's a little more, right?
(echoing) Jonathan! Jonathan! Jonathan! Jonathan, I'm right here!
Jonathan, where are you? Jonathan! (breathing heavily) Jonathan! Jonathan, I'm right... I'm right here! (faintly) Where are you?
Jonathan! 
(panting) Jonathan!
Jonathan!
Yeah.
Yeah, no. I... I don't wanna be alone. Do you?
Can you just come up here?
On.
We don't know that.
Hey.
Every time I close my eyes, I just... keep seeing that... thing. Wherever I was, that place... I think that it lives there. It was feeding there. Feeding on that deer. That means that if... if Will and Barbara...
That means that she's trapped... in that place. We have to find it again.
Maybe we don't have to. When I saw it, it was feeding on that deer.
Right. And it seems to hunt at night, like a... a lion or a coyote. But it doesn't hunt in packs like them. It's always alone, like... like a bear. And remember at Steve's, when Barb cut herself? And then, last night, the deer...
It's just a theory. We could test it.
At least we'll know it's coming.
Yeah, I'm... I'm getting dressed.
I'll be down in a second.
Monster hunting.
You know, last week... I was shopping for a new top I thought Steve might like. It took me and Barb all weekend. It seemed like life or death, you know? And... and now-
Yeah.
You. It's definitely you.
I don't know.
What is wrong with you?
What are you talking about?
You came by last night?
Look, I don't know what you think you saw but it wasn't like that.
We were just-
Jonathan, leave it.
Steve, shut up!
Steve!
Steve. Stop! Steve! Knock it off, you guys!
Jonathan, stop! Stop! You're going to hurt him! Jonathan, stop!
Guys- Jonathan, get off of him! Stop it!
Stop it! 
Do you think we'll be out of here soon?
Well, how long are you gonna keep him?
He's not my boyfriend.
What?
Found some ice.
Yeah. Everything's fine. 
What the hell are you doing?
Mike! Mike! Get back here!
Mike! Mike! Asshole!
No, it's not crap. 
It's going to be. Just... It needs some reorganizing.
Can I mark on it?
So, in the first paragraph, you used the basketball game versus Northern as a metaphor for your life, which is great. But then, around here, you start talking about your granddad's experiences in the war. And I...  I don't see how they're connected.
No. I mean... When's the deadline?
We have our dinner tonight, remember?
We already canceled last week. You don't have to go. Just work on this.
Hey, calm down.
That's not true.
Steve...
I love you, too.
Hey! Thanks. Oh, could I get one more?
You're coming to this.
I can't let you sit all alone Halloween. That's just not acceptable.
All night?
No, no way. You're gonna be home by 8:00, listening to the Talking Heads and reading Vonnegut or something.
Jonathan, just come. I mean, who knows, you might even, like, meet someone.
Oh, my God! Take those stupid things off.
It's been like an hour.
Okay. Okay, okay. God.
Yeah.
It's fine. It's great.
So, I noticed a "For Sale" sign out in your yard. Is that the neighbors', or...
No.
Um, what exactly does that mean?
Is that why you're selling the house?
[stammers] Excuse me. I'll be right back.
Jonathan.
Listen to me, okay? 
I'm at the hospital with Driscoll. 
Jonathan... Please. 
Where is he? 
Is he safe? 
Mike, open the door. 
Mrs. Driscoll. 
Last night.
Around 9:00. 
I was waiting for the doctors to run some tests. 
Hallelujah! 
Um, so, wha- what time was your... sauna test? 
Well, that proves it. That proves my theory. 
I'm sorry, I'm lost. Who is Heather? 
Heather Holloway? 
Seat belts. 
Tom? Heather? 
[sniffs] Do you guys smell that? 
Oh, God. More chemicals. 
Blood. Yesterday, Tom had a bandage on his forehead. 
He was attacked.
Yeah, but- 
I don't know. 
Yeah. 
Run! 
Here. 
It's ringing. 
Come on, pick up!
No! 
[groans]
Jonathan! 
Help! Help! Help! Is anyone here?! 
Polo! 
Go... to... hell! 
To look for Barb.
I don't know, I... I was scared.
I don't think it was a mask.
I don't know! I don't know, I just... I have a terrible feeling about this.
What?
So?
Are you serious right now?
Barb is missing! And you're worried about your dad?
(scoffs) I can't believe you right now. I can't believe you.
It wasn't really an argument. Barb just wanted to leave. I didn't, so, I.. I told her to just go home.
Then I went upstairs to put on some dry clothes.
I don't know what it was, but... I think... I think maybe it took Barb. You need to check behind Steve's house-
What?
No. No, Barb wouldn't do that, ever.
What? No!
It wasn't like that.
Steve and me, we're... we're just friends. We... we just talked.
I didn't lie!
We slept together! Is that what you want to know? It doesn't matter!
No! It is all bullshit! It has nothing to do with Barb and she's missing. And something terrible happened to her. I know it. I know it! And no one is listening to me!
No! You're not!
Just leave me alone!
Hey. Your mom, um... she said you'd be here. I just... (inhales deeply) Can we talk for a second?
And you're sure you didn't see anyone else out there?
The cops think that she ran away. But they don't know Barb. And I went back to Steve's... and I thought I... saw something. Some... weird man or... I don't know what it was. I'm sorry. I... I shouldn't have come here today. I'm... I'm so sorry.
What?
(stammers) I don't know. It was almost like he... he didn't have-
How did you know that?
And you're...
Hmm. Did your mom say anything else? Like, um, where it might have gone to, or...
How long does this take?
Have you been... doing this a while?
Photography?
No! No, it is.
What was I saying?
When you took my picture.
That's it. That's what I saw.
And if he's alive- 
Maybe it's closed?
It's not working?
Jonathan?
I think there's something in the woods.
What are you doing here?
We're looking for Mike and Will.
We're not sure.
The power's back.
Okay, so this mind flamer thing-
[sighs] What does it want?
Okay, so if this thing is like a brain that's controlling everything, then if we kill it...
Hey. What you did, um, helping the kids... that was... really cool.
Believe me, I know.
I can.
What are they doing?
