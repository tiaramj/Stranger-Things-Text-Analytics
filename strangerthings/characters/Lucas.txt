We missed you. 
Will's a part of that army. 
Mike, would you just stop already? 
The chief will take care of her. 
If we get their attention... 
They'd all come to stop us. 
Get off of me, you- 
I said get off me! [he kicks Billy]
Steve! 
That counts. 
Oh, wait, that's Mount Sinai. Make a left. 
Make a left. 
God. 
Dustin!
Ready.
You good? 
He's insane. 
There, there! 
Hey... wanna dance? 
I love this song. 
You? 
Get out of my room! 
Dude. 
Is there a bird nesting in there? 
No, of course not. Unless you want to. 
So, he's building an army, just like we thought.
Like, royally.
Game over.
[opens the doors] Come on!
Come on! Come on!
Does any of this help?
A bowl?
[stammers] Okay.
Bowl... Bowl... Bowl... Why wouldn't it be with the cereal?
What else do you use a bowl for?
Oh, shit. 
Satan's Baby. You ever shot one of these suckers?
That's an understatement.
Nah, it's way better. There is a reason this warning label says "18 or older." This sucker is filled with 150 grains of black powder. AKA gunpowder. Strap two of these together, and it's bigger than an M-80. Five of them, we've got ourselves a stick of dynamite.
Do you have a better idea?
Against that thing? She's gonna need some backup.
Hold this.
[whispers] Oh, sorry.
Because it's delicious.
It's like Carpenter's The Thing. The original is a classic, no question about it. But the remake... [slurping loudly] [satisfied sigh] [smacking lips] Sweeter, bolder... better.
So, you prefer the original Thing?
It's the same concept, dude.
It is the same concept.
[yells] Yes, it is.
Sorry.
The movies? Dustin's so freaked out about the gate, he decides to go watch a movie? Yeah, makes total sense.
Keep mocking my plan, Max. Keep mocking it. I wanna hear you say it again, because you keep doubting me. You keep doubting me!
Will?
What are you doing here?
What are you talking about?
Okay, Russians? As in, they're working for the Russian government? 
The field!
Two episodes in two days.
You think it's True Sight?
It's nothing.
Well, well, well. Look who finally decided to show up. After I drew the short straw. Real convenient. 
Are you just gonna stand there? [throws Dustin a stick] Or you gonna help?
Anything?
Sorry, Max.
A shadow? [stammers] What kind of shadow?
Can it hurt him? I mean, if this shadow thing isn't from our world...
So what do we do?
Hey, Max. Have you seen Dustin? We're supposed to meet after class.
Max! Hey, Max! Hey, where you going? Come on! We've gotta go look for Dart.
What is wrong with you?
I don't understand.
That's not true!
We do. But it's...
[sighs] There... there are just things. Things we can't tell you, all right? For your own safety.
Yes!
What? No!
How do you know about El?
That was different. Trust me. Okay? That was just... just different.
Max!
[sniffs] Oh, shit!
You seriously think that the weirdo knows where Will is?
Okay.
Yeah. Binoculars... from 'Nam. Army knife... also from 'Nam. Hammer, camouflage bandana... and the wrist rocket.
First of all, it's a wrist rocket. And second of all, the Demogorgon's not real. It's made up. But if there is something out there, I'm gonna shoot it in the eye... and blind it.
Seriously?
She shut one door!
Idiot.
She's not a superhero. She's a weirdo.
If you love her so much, why don't you marry her?
Mike, seriously?
You look at her all, like... "Hi, El! El! El! El! I love you so much! Would you marry me?"
You all right?
Oh, yeah. Yeah, this is the monster killer!
Whoo!
What are we doing here?
Um... no!
That's exactly what we did. I told you she didn't know what the hell she was talking about!
Mike, don't waste your time with her.
Call the cops, like we should have done yesterday.
What other choice do we have?
It's Will. It's really Will.
Mike, come on. Don't do this, man. Mike...
Mike!
It's not the Demogorgon.
Told ya. (chuckling)
Fireball him!
Don't be a pussy. Fireball him!
Fireball him!
Where'd it go? Where is it?
Where is it?
Can you find it yet?
Oh, my God! Freaking idiot!
It was a seven? Did Mike see it? Then it doesn't count.
Yeah. It's because she's been dating that douchebag, Steve Harrington.
Later.
Good night, ladies.
I'm telling you, his mom's right. He probably just went to class early again.
Assholes.
California?
Oh, man! When Will sees this, he's totally gonna blow his shit.
Sorry.
What are you doing?
No, it's from <i>Lord of the Rings</i>.
It doesn't matter.
(mockingly) "He asked!"
Shut up
Shut up!
Yeah.
Hey, it's Lucas.
I'm done. Over.
(sighs) Yeah. This is crazy. Over.
What's your point? Over.
Meet me in ten. Over and out.
Ah, man. This is it.
Byers!
Seriously, Dustin? You wanna be a baby, then go home already!
No, you're just being a big sissy!
What? 
Gross.
Mike, in case you forgot, we're still fugitives. The bad men are still looking for us.
Exactly. We stay here, keep El out of sight and keep her safe. That's the most important thing, remember? Besides, she's okay. She's with Jonathan.
Yeah. 
What is it?
How did they find us? 
Come on!
We gotta go.
Eat shit! 
No! 
What? 
Go, go! 
Give me one. 
Give me another one. 
It's not working! 
Eleven! 
You had a funeral. 
And Troy peed himself.
Yes! 
Well, we call her "El" for short. 
[whispers] She has superpowers. 
: Then she squeezed the brains out... 
Agents just started grabbing us and stuff... 
It's not the thessalhydra. 
Fireball him!
The campaign was way too short. , , 
And the proud princess? 
Dustin farted. 
Dustin farted! 
No, you stop. 
Dad?
When Mom's mad at you, how do you make her not mad?
Even when she's wrong?
Not really.
To hang out with Dustin.
I told you I would.
Sorry. I just needed a safe place.
Listen. I'm gonna tell you the truth about everything that happened last year. But if anyone finds out, you could be arrested. [sighs] Possibly killed.
I need to know. Do you accept the risk?
Do you accept the risk?
Last year... Will didn't get lost in the woods. He got lost somewhere else.
And that was the last we ever saw of her. After that, she was just gone. I can't believe it's been that long. Feels like yesterday.
It's crazy. [sighs] I know.
Liked it?
Issues?
What are you talking about?
You don't believe me?
Why would I make this up?
I tell you all of this. I mean, top-secret stuff. Risking my life. And this is how you react?
Oh, so this is funny to you?
Where are you going?
It's not a joke.
[sighs] We have a lot of rules in our party, but the most important is, "Friends don't lie." Never ever. No matter what.
[sighs] I had to do that. To protect you.
Lower your voice.
Max, I'm serious, shut up!
Stop talking.  You're going to get us killed. Do you understand?
I really wish I wasn't.
I can't.
Yes.
Do you believe me?
I don't even understand. Why lie?
Did he say he'd kill you?
So then, what's the big deal?
I just wish you'd consulted me, because the way you handled this, you're in deep shit.
I'm not gonna lie, it's gonna be bad.
But... you can fix this. It's just one little mistake. I've made hundreds, thousands. Max has dumped me five times. But what have I done? Huh? Have I despaired? No. I've marched back into battle, and I've won her back every single freaking time.
I'll show you. Come on.
Something pretty and shiny that says "I'm sorry."
No!
Three hundred? Three hundred.
Hey, Mike.
No.
Haven't got that much.
Split it with what? Does that even make sense?
She's sick. She's super sick That's why we're here, actually.
For Nana.
Super hard. It's- It's expensive.
No.
[sighs] I knew it. [snatches back his He-Man figure]
What are you talking about? 
Sorry, man. My stupid sister turned it off. 
Wait. What? 
Steve? 
Steve Harrington? 
I have proof. 
Come on, hop on. Hurry. 
I said medium-well! 
So what? 
You wanted to tell her, too. 
Who you conveniently found. 
I'm saying you have a creepy little bond with him.
And you haven't heard from Mike? 
Or Will? 
Hopper? 
She didn't believe me anyway.
That must be it. So, we good? 
Okay! Stupid.
Huh? 
You miss it? 
The ocean. The waves? California? Hawkins seems pretty lame, I bet. 
Why? 
Yeah. 
So he takes it out on you?
Well, I do now. 
I like talking with you, Mad Max. 
Hold on! 
I've got eyes! Ten o'clock! [stutters] Ten o'clock! 
What? 
Steve, watch out! 
Three o'clock! Three o'clock! 
Steve, run! 
They can't get in! They can't! 
What happened?
Did you run away?
Is that blood?
She's freaking me out!
She said "no" and "yes." Your three-year-old sister says more.
There's something seriously wrong with her. Like, wrong in the head.
I bet she escaped from Pennhurst.
The nuthouse in Kerley County.
Bite me. Seriously though, think about it. That would explain her shaved hair and why she's so crazy.
She's an escapee is the point. She's probably a psycho.
Exactly! We should've never brought her here.
Yes! We went out to find Will, not another problem.
I second that.
How is that crazy?
So?
Our houses become Alcatraz.
Wouldn't want her in my house.
I'm telling you, his stupid plan failed.
Yeah, but obviously it was stupid, or he'd be here.
He's in deep shit right about now.
Oh, my God, she didn't.
No way. Mike would never rat us out.
All that matters is, after school, the freak will be back in the loony bin, and we can focus on what really matters, finding Will.
Are you out of your mind?
You are out of your mind!
You could tell?
Then why doesn't she tell us? Do you know where he is?  Do you know where Will is?
She should be scared! If you know where he is, tell us! This is nuts. We have to take her to your mom.
Her name is Eleven?
No, no, no! We're going back to plan A. We're telling your mom.
Oh, no, I had two bologna sandwiches for lunch. I don't know why.
We just wanted to find our friend.
Yeah, friend. Will?
Especially when there's spit.
A spit swear means... (spits) you never break your word. It's a bond.
Nothing.
Do I have to go through this again?
Nothing. Nothing. That's my whole point. You are the victim here.
Mike-
Mike, stop. Relax. Just relax. Okay? Stop asking rational questions.
Yeah.
Precisely. It's a totally different species.
Will, not right now.
Tons.
I got that beat.
What are you doing?
What is happening right now?
Uh... Can I at least take a shower first?
Attack?
I think so.
Y-Yeah, totally.
Come on, Will.
Hey, Will! Come on, man! We're sorry! Will!
Egon!
Will!
Ugh, he's like a living booger. [passes him to Will]
Yeah, but aren't there nonaquatic pollywogs? 
So, if he's not a pollywog or a reptile... 
We gotta show him to Mr. Clarke. 
Dustin, Jesus! Just show him! 
I don't understand. 
Will saw something that looked like Dart last year? 
True Sight?
[sighs] Elaborate. 
So that would mean... 
[sighs] We have to take him to Hopper. 
He trusts you?
Just open it already.
Holy shit! 
Oh, shit! 
Where'd he go? 
We're coming! 
(over radio) Do you copy? This is a code red. 
She turned it off.
He's not answering. 
Dustin, do you copy? I repeat, this is a code red.
A new host.
I think I just threw up in my mouth. 
Heat him up... 
Uh, Will? Um, you know, about yesterday... 
Got it. 
Max, come on! 
No way. 
No way. 
And empty.
I don't know. The stupid radio kept going in and out.
Or maybe like Hawkins. 
What'd she say?
What?
Do you understand what he's talking about?
Yeah. And he wasn't there.
In real life, dummy.
[sighing] Oh, my God!
“Will! Will, it's us! Are you there?”
“Why can't he hear us?”
We're... in... mourning.
We have some questions.
So, theoretically, how do we travel there?
Yeah, that's not what we're talking about.
Theoretically.
So we can't go upside down? 
Theoretical.
What we want to know is, do you know where the gate is?
Then how do you know about the Upside Down?
Dustin!
Yeah, so?
So what's wrong with them?
Meaning, if we follow the compasses' north... 
[sighs] How much further?
I'm just saying. How do we know when we get to the gate?
[sighs] Do you think she's acting weird?
I mean, weirder than normal?
"Oh, no"? What's, "Oh, no"?
Are you sure?
And you're just realizing this now? 
Because you're the compass genius!
[sighs]
It's not a magnet. She's been acting weirder than normal. If she can slam doors with her mind, she can definitely screw up a compass.
Because she's trying to sabotage our mission. Because she's a traitor!
You did it, didn't you? You don't want us to reach the gate. You don't want us to find Will.
Admit it.
Admit it! [he grabs her arm to check her sleeve] Fresh blood. I knew it.
I saw her wiping her nose on the tracks! She was using her powers! 
What did I tell you? She's been playing us from the beginning!
Find Will? Find Will? Where is he, then? Huh? I don't see him.
No, I actually don't. Just think about it, Mike. She could've just told us where the Upside Down was right away, but she didn't. She just made us run around like headless chickens.
No! She used us, all of us! She helped just enough so she could get what she wants. Food and a bed. She's like a stray dog.
No! Screw you, Mike. You're blind.. blind because you like that a girl's not grossed out by you. But wake up, man! Wake the hell up! She knows where Will is, and now she's just letting him die in the Upside Down.
For all we know, it's her fault.
We're looking for some stupid monster... but did you ever stop to think that maybe she's the monster?
Get off of me!
Get off of me!
Oh, shit. Is that, like, a real thing?
Killing, flaying... 
Wait, what? 
No. 
I care. 
Just a family discussion. 
You're late.
Again.
“If you guys keep whining about it. Nyeh-nyeh-nyeh.”
Let me guess. You were busy. 
Will thinks it's funny.
I'm spending romantic time with my girlfriend.
Sorry, sorry, sorry!
Isn't it past your bedtime?
Psycho!
Mall rat!
We missed the previews.
Skittles.
Ow, ow, ow. Ow.
Still stings.
Is that a new zit?
I was just asking! [SCREAMS]
Girlfriend!?
Aren't we high enough?
Oh, shit. She doesn't have electricity?
They're lying.
I'm so thirsty.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Mmm.
Or maybe Suzie doesn't exist.
...son of a bitch!
Yes, I copy! They know about Eleven! Get out of there! They know about Eleven! The bad men are coming! All of them! Do you hear me? The bad men are coming!
The bad men are coming!
Dustin! Dustin, do you copy?
Where are you?
Meet me at Elm and Cherry!
Where are they?
Awesome. It was awesome. 
Everything I said about you being a traitor and stuff... I was wrong. I'm sorry.
This is Randolph Road, right here. The fence starts here, and goes all the way around. And this is the lab right here. The gate's gotta be in there somewhere. It's gotta be.
The sign says "Department of Energy."
Mike's right. There's soldiers out front.
Weapons.
Really bad. The place is like a fortress.
Let's go, let's go, let's go!
Come on!
Get down!
Is that your sister?
She said it was an emergency.
It's your sister!
Why is she with the chief? 
It's not a trap. Why would the chief set us up? Nancy, maybe, but the chief?
Would you shut up about Lando?
When do you feel good about anything?
You think they saw us?
That we tracked to Hawkins Lab. 
Like, she flipped the van earlier.
No, this way.
Try that side.
Pull it back. Pull it back.
One, two, three.
Colder! Warmer! Right there!
Shut up.
Egon! Yeah!
What?
Because I'm Venkman.
I specifically didn't agree to Winston.
No one wants to be Winston, man.
What's wrong with Winston? He joined the team super late, he's not funny, and he's not even a scientist!
If he's cool, then you be Winston.
Why not?
[mocking Mike] Because you're not black?
You thought it.
Mike!
Crap.
Not right now. We look like morons.
Of course she likes Ghostbusters, but that's not the point. The point is we're dressed up and she isn't.
No. 
Right. [sniffs]
Yup.
Lucas.
[stutters] Uh, no. Actually... We weren't stalking you.
Yeah, for your safety.
[stuttering] So many bullies, it's crazy.
Go!
Mad Max.
Will!
Yeah! You ready for tonight, man?
If I get another 3 Musketeers, I'm gonna kill myself.
"What's wrong with 3 Musketeers?" 
Top three?
Yeah!
It's, like, [imitates surfer] totally tubular.
What a gnarly wave, dude.
Is he okay?
Yeah. It sorta destroyed your cabin.
Sorry.
And kill it. Theoretically.
Erica!
You guys survived.
Yeah, man. We missed you, dude.
Erica.
Didn't your mom just buy this car?
Do we have gas?
Come on.
We gotta go!
Go, go, go, go!
Maybe we wore it out.
Flay this, you ugly piece of shit!
I know!
Damn it!
[packing and singing] ♪ Turn around, Look at what you see, In her face, The mirror of your dreams, Rhymes that keep their secrets, Will unfold behind the clouds ♪
So then join in, Dusty-bun. [blows air kiss]
[wait a beat and look at each other] ♪ Turn around, Look at what you see, In their face ♪
♪ The mirror of your dreams ♪
♪ Rhymes that keep their secrets ♪
What do you want?
Okay, I'll shake. On one condition. We forget the weirdo and go straight to the gate.
Fine!
Yeah, I agree. But this is the party, right here in this room.
Um, no, she's not. Not even close! Never will be. She's a liar, a traitor-
An accident?
Awesome?
I could have been killed!
If you two wanna waste your time looking for a traitor, go ahead, 'cause I'm not spending my time on her anymore. No way! I'm going to the gate. I'm gonna find Will.
Oh, man.
Take your puny haul and multiply it by five.
While you were scrounging around like a homeless bum, I mowed Old Man Humphrey's lawn.
Just call Mike already.
I have to go take a shower from doing real work, like a man. Over and out.
Hey!
You're not nimble enough. But you'll get there one day. But until then, Princess Daphne is still mine.
Then who is it?
Mike, come on. Just get him the date.
But it's for a good cause.
(whispers) Mad Max.
But her name is Max.
So, how many Maxes do you know?
Exactly. So she's gotta be Mad Max. 
He's always weird when he has to go in.
He's always quiet.
Jack shit.
So go home. I'll radio if she comes.
Oh, 'cause you're such a threat.
What?
They're arguing. They're arguing.
She's incredible.
What do we do now?
Mike's not gonna like it.
What if Max says no?
I told you to stop that.
Later.
Woods? 
Find Billy and stop him. 
Then we win. 
I mean, I don't know. 
Ooh. 
If there are two flayed- 
What's a good scream? 
Yeah, if you're human. 
Extended. 
Dude, I think that was it.
The olive branch. 
Yeah! [laughs] 
That was good, that was good. 
(on the radio) Go away, Mike. I'm not in the mood, all right? Over and out.
What about Will? You mean about his funeral? Over.
What?
Yeah, I heard a baby. 
Mike, you obviously tapped into a baby monitor. It's probably the Blackburns' next door. 
Mike... 
Oh, well, if the weirdo heard him, then I guess-
 Are you actually believing this crap? 
Did you guys not see what I saw? They pulled Will's body out of the water. He's dead!
So how do you know that? 
Then what was in that water?
The Heathkit's at school. There is no way we're gonna get the weirdo in there without anyone noticing. I mean... look at her.
What?
Hey.
Upset.
Cousin-
Cold!
Yep!
They probably didn't even know his name till today.
Oh. Mike! Let's go!
Now what?
Calm down. She just closed her eyes.
No way!
Will, it's us! Are you there?
Why can't he hear us?
Oh!
You're positive that was Dart?
Wait, a cat? Dart ate a cat?
I knew it! You kept him!
Bullshit!
Oh, so now you admit it?
I care! You put the party in jeopardy! You broke the rule of law!
What?
You wanted to tell her, too!
No, no! We're not even. Don't even try that. Your stupid pet could have ate us for dinner!
He was crawling to come say hello?
It's the lab. They were going back home.
Really?
Yeah.
But there's an army now.
And so does Dart.
Analogy.
We are talking about the destruction of our world as we know it.
Theoretically.
And we know the monsters are gonna molt again.
She's not my girlfriend. 
She was just scared.
Feel what?
He won't find out.
Judgment day.
Yeah, got it.
