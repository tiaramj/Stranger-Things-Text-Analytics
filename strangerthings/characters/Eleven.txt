Mike. [gasps] 
353 days. I heard.
Where have you been? [they have a moment and hug]
I missed you, too. 
[puts her thumb in his mouth] Teeth. 
You have teeth. 
[cries] 
Can I see him?
I know. I saw. 
Yes. 
I can do it.
I'm hearing you. I can do it.
You won't lose me. 
[sighs deeply] 
About what? 
To see Mama. 
A truck. 
A big truck. 
A man's. 
A nice man. [Hopper has a surprised Pikachu face]
I... I shouldn't have left. 
A black hole?
Who's Sarah? 
Where is she? 
Gone. 
Stupid? 
[chuckles] 
[she takes his hand] I've been stupid, too. 
Bitchin'.
[chuckles and sniffles] 
[breathing heavily]
[sniffles and cries]
I don't know how. 
He said he was building something. That it was all for me.
He also said he was gonna kill all of you.
[groans]
Bitchin'.
Yeah?
What makes you crazy?
"Girlfriends"?
"Boyfriends."
[softly] A feeling...
Old people?
Hey.
Sounded like "gate."
My leg. My leg.
[wailing]
He didn't see me.
Nobody saw me!
You promised... I go! And I never leave! Nothing ever happens!
You lie!
No!
No! No! No. No!
You are like Papa!
I hate you.
"Ives. Terry." 
Jane. Papa.
Mama?
Mama! [crying] Mama?
[crying] Mama! [shrieking] Mama! Mama... [sobbing] Mama!
Power lines?
Yes.
"Three-one-five."
Three-one-five. Three-one-five. Three-one-five.
Why did they hurt you?
Mike...
Friends tell the truth.
Mouth breather?
Knucklehead?
Mike...
I understand.
Here.
Hiding.
Mike...
Mike...
No.
Eleven.
Eleven.
No. 
Yes.
Demogorgon.
What's "putting"? 
Eggos? 
Will you be like my brother? 
Why "no"? 
Why? 
Mike? 
Friends don't lie. 
"Snow Ball"? 
No? 
A friend? 
Papa? 
Bad. Bad. Mike. Mike. [grunts] Mike. 
[softly] Promise?
No more. 
Yes. Five-fifteen.
Thank you.
Long time.
Thin Mints?
I want to see Mama.
Mama?
Mama, can you hear me?
Mama? It's me... Jane. [puts her hand on Terry's] I'm here now.
What's wrong with Mama?
She won't get better... will she?
A good dream?
Is it the same dream?
Home?
Pretty.
Okay.
No.
It's Mama.
She knows I'm here.
She wants to talk.
Yes.
Yes.
No.
Stop talking.
Mama?
Mama, it's me...
Jane.
I'm here now.
I'm home.
[echoing] Mama!
Mama! Mama!
What do I do? Mama, what do I do? Help me!
Yes.
[sighs and goes into her room] It's 9:32. Where are you?
What... Why not?
But Hop said that your Nana was okay, that it was a false alarm.
Oh.
Was that your mom?
You can come over after?
Do you lie?
Hi.
Can we talk?
And then he said he- he missed me. And then he just hung up.
What?
But friends don't lie.
Doesn't exist?
Give him the medicine.
Where are we going?
Too many people. Against the rules.
How do I know... what I like?
Like me?
Shopping.
Yeah. Am I your pet?
Then why do you treat me like garbage?
You said Nana was sick.
You lie. Why do you lie?
I dump your ass.
No.
Yes.
'Night, Mike.
No.
No.
Bad.
(mimes a gun) Understand?
Pretty.
Promise?
(sobs) Mike.
Promise.
(nose bleeding) No.
"Friend"?
What is "friend"?
Spit?
Will.
Hiding.
Macchio?
I don't know. He's my first boyfriend.
Max.
I see them.
Eating.
They say we are "species."
"Emotion, not logic."
Yeah! Jeez!
Max wanted to have... a sleepover. Is that... okay?
Ready. [she spins the bottle]
Yeah, boring.
Against the rules?
Max-
Max!
I found him.
I don't know.
He's... on the floor...
...talking to someone.
You don't believe me? 
But the screams.
They scream?
Happy screams? What is happy screams?
Max?
We found this.
We could give it back to her.
A door. A red door.
[muffled] No!
What?
Where is she?
El.
[murmurs] I- I saw... I saw you-
He says he needs me.
Friends don't lie. 
When is "soon"?
When?
On day 500?
On day 600?
Day 700? On day 800?
I need to see him.
Home.
Not stupid.
Do I have a mother? 
Where is she? 
Gone? 
School. Where is school? 
[screaming] No! 
I don't know.
It doesn't make sense. 
Heather. The blood. The ice. 
What about Billy? 
He seemed wrong. 
Who... is that? 
What did he say?
No. 
I closed the gate. 
[screaming as she closes the gate] 
How can you tell if someone is a host?
Where are you going? 
I know. 
What if he's right? 
Hop. 
But if I only see you, 
I make my own rules. 
Hi. 
No! No! No! 
[screams] No!
[choking] No... [gasping for air]
Upside down.. 
Go. 
What's going on? 
Oh. 
I found him. 
Billy knows it. Billy's been there. To the source. 
Mike. I need you to trust me. 
[shivering breaths] 
[screams] Stop! No! No! No! No! 
[sighs] [softly] I'm okay. 
I'm... on a beach.
A woman. She's... pretty. I... I think she's looking at me. 
There's... a boy. 
It's Billy. 
I think I see it. The source. 
[panting] 
I think I found it. [Eleven panting] The source. 
Brimborn... Steelworks. 
[gasps] 
[sobbing] 
No! 
[screaming] Get away!
No! 
[sobbing] 
Mike! Mike, stop! Stop!
Mike! Stop! Mike! Mike!
[laughing] Stop!
No! [she laughs]
It was like a tomato!
I wish I was still with you.
Tomorrow.
I have to go home.
[to Dustin] Good luck.
Yes?
Still pretty?
Yes?
Friends... friends don't lie. I'm sorry, too.
Yes.
Yes.
The Upside Down.
I'm sorry.
I can't find them.
The bath.
I can find them. In the bath.
Yes. 
Ready.
Barb? Barbara?
Gone! Gone! Gone! Gone! Gone! Gone. Gone.
Gone.
Gone. Gone!
Gone!
Castle Byers. Castle Byers. 
Will. Will?
Your mom... she's coming for you.
Just... just hold on a little longer. Will. Will.
Will? Will!
Mike? Mike?
Mike? Mike! [screaming] Mike! Mike!
Ghost.
Halloween.
They wouldn't see me.
The bad men.
Trick or treat.
Yes, but-
No, but they wouldn't see me.
But they wouldnâ€™t see me.
We're not stupid!
[stutters] "Compromise"?
By 5-1-5?
Promise?
Halfway happy.
"Me?"
"Impetuous."
"People are going to be aghast."
L... A... T... E. Late.
Mike.
No!
[sobs] Okay.
[spits out the spoon] No! Stop it! Stop! Stop!
[grunts] I can do it. I can do it.
God!
God!
My battery's low, but...
...it will recharge.
I can fight.
Yeah.
Let me try.
[sighs] I can do it.
There's another way... to get out. Through the Gap.
Seven... feet. [gasps]
You told her... the wave was seven feet.
You ran to her, on the beach.
There were seagulls.
She wore a hat...
...with a blue ribbon.
A long dress... with a blue and red flower. Yell- Yellow sandals, covered in sand. She was pretty.
She was really pretty. And you... you were happy.
Mike!
I'm sorry.
It's okay. It's okay. It's okay. It's okay.
Thanks.
Yes.
Did you talk to your mom? About Thanksgiving?
I like presents, too. 
Cool.
Mike?
[sighs] Remember that day... at the cabin, you were talking to Max?
You talked about your- your feelings, your heart.
Mike...
I love you, too.
Donation box?
What is that?
Speech?
Can I read?
[laughs] [sniffles] [sobs]
Yeah. [sniffles] Time to go?
I'll be out in a minute.
Yes, Papa.
Yes.
Mouth breather.
Go.
Mike... I'm sorry.
The gate... I opened it. I'm the monster.
Eight-fifteen.
Yes.
I found him.
Woods.
He's with... Will's mom. 
Ill... annoy. They're going to Ill-annoy. 
[stammers] Ill-annoy. 
Only when I talk. 
Heather. Billy was doing something to her. 
She was scared. She was screaming. 
Bad screams. 
Max said- 
Somewhere he didn't want me to see. 
How do we find it? 
Hi. 
Thanks. 
Will.
(whispers) Pretty. Good.
Eleven-
Thank you.
Bad place-
Mouth breather.
(softly) Hurt him?
Listen?
Mmm-hmm.
Mama? It's me. Jane. I'm home.
Repeat?
She kept showing the girl in the room.
Different.
I think this is why Mama wanted to talk.
I think she wants me to find her.
[exhales] No.
Hello?
Becky! Becky, I found her.
Mouth breather.
Hello?
I'm looking for my sister.
I saw her. Here.
Kali?
No one.
I saw her.
Mama.
In her dream circle.
I saw you. In the rainbow room.
Jane.
Sister.
Yes.
Three hundred and twenty-seven days.
Yes. He says soon.
Wait. Do you have a gift?
Is that why you made the man with the crazy hair dance?
You made him see spiders?
Are you real?
What's wrong?
Yes.
Home.
What time is it?
The spider hater?
They're not like us.
Outcasts?
Fight who?
You hurt the bad men?
You kill them?
I'm a fighter. I've killed.
They hurt me.
Festered?
Yes.
I can't.
Yes.
Good.
[points] Him. He hurt Mama.
Bitchin'.
What are we doing?
[uses her powers] He's watching television.
I saw him. No one else.
You hurt Mama.
Papa is gone.
They were kids.
Face who?
Papa is dead.
You're not real.
Go away.
Get out of my head.
[screaming] Get out of my head! [crying]
Compromise?
Mike!
Mike! Mike! Mike! Mike! Mike, where are you? Mike! Mike!
I'm sorry. I'm sorry, but I have to go back. My friends... My friends are in danger.
Your mother sent you here for a reason, remember? We belong together. There's nothing for you back there. They cannot save you, Jane.
No. But I can save them.
I'm going to my friends. I'm going home.
