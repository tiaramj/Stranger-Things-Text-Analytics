[sighs] Hey. Hey, sweetheart. [they hug]
[sniffles] Hey.
He's not doing well. 
What else did you see?
You opened this gate before, right? 
He likes it cold.
We need to burn it out of him. 
We'll do it here. 
No! 
Just wait! 
Jonathan, wait! 
Just wait! 
No, leave it! 
Leave it! 
Will, baby. Will. Will. Please, Will. Will. 
Please. Can you hear me? 
Please. Will. 
[gasps] Oh, honey. Oh, God. [she hugs him tightly] 
Yeah, you got it. See? 
[laughs] Wow! 
Yeah. It's just what's happening. 
Hey. 
You know. 
Two-man rule?
All right, so we get the keys, and then we turn the machine off.
All right, well, that shouldn't be too hard. We can do this.
Yeah, but there has to be a way in.
Who are coming.
You know what, if you can't handle this, then just turn around and drop me off first.
I will do anything if it gets me away from you! 
You are way off base, buddy!
Who, Larry?
I'm not, I haven't.
I just- I just wanna find the kids.
Hey. Hey. Karen.
Hey, Karen.
Where are the kids?
What?
Okay.
Alexei! Oh, my God.
Oh, God. Oh, no.
[walks over to Kline] Hey! Larry.
Dustin!
What's going on? Where's Will?
Will! Will! Will! Sweetie, wake up! It's Mom! Will!
Will, wake up! Can you hear me?
Will, please, just wake up. Please, wake up!
It's Mom! It's me!
[sighs] I need you to try.
Will, I need you to tell me the truth.
This shape, I saw it on the video tape from Halloween night. It's the same shape as... as your drawing. [sighs] These episodes that you're having, I think Dr. Owens is wrong. I think they're real. But... but I can't help you if I don't know what's going on. So, you have to talk to me. Please. No more secrets, okay?
Did... did you see this thing again on the field?
What... what is it?
Like the one you had that night at the arcade?
[stutters] What does it want?
Well, what does that mean?
It's okay. It's okay. Hey. Listen. Look, look at me. I will never, ever let anything bad happen to you ever again. Whatever's going on in you, we're gonna fix it. I will fix it. I promise. I'm here.
Flo, it's Joyce again.
He's still not there?
Did he get any of my messages from yesterday? Did you give-
No, no, I need Hopper. Just tell him to call me the second he gets in. Please. Thank you.
Hey. How you feeling, sleepyhead? Any better? 
Same as last night? Still weird?
All right. [sighs] Hmm. [puts a thermometer in his mouth] Okay, let me see. 
No. Uh, actually, it's cold. Do you feel cold?
And I meant it. No doctor. You know what? I'm gonna run you a nice bath and it'll warm you up and hopefully get you feeling better. How's that sound? Okay.
Yeah, sweetie, what is it?
[sighs] I... I can cool it down a little bit, baby, but we gotta get your body temp back up.
What?
Leave it open. Where the hell have you been?
Hey! Knock, knock. We have a visitor.
I know it's hard but can you just... Can you try? For us?
The memories?
Oh!
No, no, no. It's okay, sweetie. Hey, hey, sweetie... what if you didn't have to use words?
Hey, you've reached the Byers. We're sorry...
This is more of the same.
Wait!
Wait. Wait. These black lines, see?
Look, they connect. They connect.
No. [sighs] I mean, is it some sort of maze or a road? [stammers] I mean, it's sort of forking and branching like... like lightning.
No, the storm he drew was completely different. He used red. And this is all blue and it has some weird dirt color. I mean, maybe it's roots. 'Cause remember, he was saying it was spreading and-
Hey, Mike.
You know what? Now is not a really good time.
[sighs] Yeah. You know, he's... he's just not feeling real well. He's laying down, so I'll tell him you stopped by, okay?
(softly) Will? Will? Sweetheart, can you hear me? Will... Please... Will... (grunts) It's me. It's me. Just talk to me. Talk to me. Just say... (stammers)
Jonathan! (stammering) Come here. Come here.
Come here. Come here. (sniffles)
It's Will. It's Will, he's... he's trying to talk to me. (breath trembling)
Yes, through... through the lights.
I know. I know. Just... just watch. Will... your brother's here. Can you show him what you showed me, baby? Please... 
(gasps) Did you see that?
No.
No! It is not the electricity, Jonathan. Something is going on here! Yesterday, the wall-
I don't know. I don't know.
(stammers) I just know that Will is here.
(stammering) Maybe if I get more lamps- (gets up)
(sits back down) Okay. (stammering) 
Okay, okay. Okay, I'm sorry. (sniffling) I'm sorry.
(sniffling) Yeah.
I promise. I will.
Yeah. I just need to sit here for a minute. (sniffles)
Okay.
(whispers) Will?
Just ring me up, Donald.
Hey, Karen.
Oh! Thank you, uh... Uh, you wanna... come in?
Will always loved Christmas, you know. So I thought if I... I put the lights up... I don't know, he... I'd feel like he was home somehow. (stammers) It's silly, I know.
(inhales deeply) You know, he's good at taking care of himself. He always has been, you know? I... (scoffs) I mean, he thinks I'm losing my mind, but...
Uh, no No, I just... We're having electrical problems.
Thank you. Thanks.
How... how's Mike dealing with this? Is he, uh, okay?
Hey! She shouldn't be here.
Wait, did you see something?
What did... what did you see? Tell me. What did you see? What-
Listen... Karen, thank you for the casserole, but I need you to leave. Okay?
Will... are you here? 
Okay, good, good, good, good. Are you... Um, blink once for yes, twice for no. Can you do that for me, sweetie? Can you do...
Oh, good boy. Good boy. Baby, I need to know... Are you alive?
Are you safe?
I need to know where to find you, honey. Where... where are you? Can you... can you tell me where you are? Can you...  Please, baby. I need to find you. Tell me what to do. Please just... Will...
Okay, baby, talk to me. Talk to me. Where are you? "R." Good, good, good, good. That's good. Come on, come on. "I"... "G"... "H"... "T"... "H"... "E"... "R"... "E"... "Right here." "Right here"? I don't know what that means. I need you to tell me what to do. What should I do? How do I get to you? How do I find you? What should I do?
Where the hell are they? Jonathan?
Ugh, I did. Oh... Got them. Okay, sweetie, I will see you tonight.
Where's Will?
(sighs) Jonathan, you have to make sure he's up!
I told you this a thousand times. Will! Come on, honey. It's time to get up. He came home last night, right?
Did he come home or not?
You don't know?
You were working?
Jonathan, we've talked about this.
You can't take shifts when I'm working.
(sighs) I can't believe you. I can't believe you sometimes.
(over the phone) Hi, Karen. It's Joyce.
(over the phone) Was that Will I heard back there?
(over the phone) Will didn't spend the night?
(over the phone) Um, you know what? I think he just left early for... for school. Thank you so much. Bye.
I have been waiting here over an hour, Hopper.
I'm going out of my mind!
No, not my Will. He's not like that. He wouldn't do that.
Look, he's not like you, Hopper. He's not like me. He's not like...most. He has a couple of friends, but, you know, the kids, they're mean. They make fun of him. They call him names. They laugh at him, his clothes--
I don't know. Does that matter?
Look, he's...he's a sensitive kid. Lonnie...(sighs) Lonnie used to say he was queer. (softly) Called him a fag.
He's missing is what he is.
Uh, last I heard, he was in Indianapolis. That was about a year ago. But he has nothing to do with this.
You know, Hopper, he has nothing to do with this. Trust me
(stammers) What about the other time?
You said, "99 out of 100". What about the other time, the one?
The one!
Okay, fine. I will call Lonnie. He will talk to me before he talks to--
A cop! (voice breaking) Just find my boy, Hop. Find him!
RIng-a-ding-ding! Anybody home?
Uh, Rada... (stammering) Radaga-- Radagast?
Thank you, sir. So, guess what? I got off early and... Ta-da! <i>Poltergeist.</i>
I changed my mind. As long as you don't have nightmares for a week.
Oh, yeah? Not even of clowns?
What about my witch? Ooh...
But Will Byers... I'm going to cook you up in my--
Will?
Will!
Will? Will! Where are you?
(over the phone) Is Lonnie there?
(over the phone) Can you please--
Who is this?
Cynthia.
Cynthia, this is Joyce.
Lonnie's ex-wife. I really need to speak to him--
Can you please put-- No!
No, not later. Now! Can--
Bitch!
What?
Lonnie, some teenager just hung up on me. Will is... Is missing. I don't know where he is. (voice breaking) I need... I just need you to call me back, please, just--
Damn it! Damn it!
What?
It was just lying there?
Did it have any blood on it, or--
(stammers) You think I didn't check my own house?
What? I don't know. Probably. I mean, I have two boys. Look at this place.
Nothing, he's probably just hungry. Come on.
Jonathan, wow. You took these? These are great. (sniffling) Wow, they really are. I know I haven't been there for you. (stammers) I've been... working so hard and I... I just feel bad. I don't even... barely know what's going on with you.
All right? I am sorry about that.
Hey, what is it? What is it, honey?
Tell me. Tell me. Come on. You can...
(hoarsely) No. Oh, no. You can't do that to yourself. This was not your fault. Do you hear me? He is... close. I know it. (stammers) I... I feel it in my heart. (sniffles) You just have to... You have to trust me on this, okay?
Oh, look at this. Look at this one. Look at this one.
I mean, that's it, right?
(hoarsely) That's it. That's the one.
Hello?
Hello?
Lonnie?
Hopper?
Who is this?
Will? Will?
(yelling) Who is this?
(yelling) What have you done to my boy?
Give me back my son!
(sobbing) It was him.
Yes.
(sobbing) He just breathed. He just breathed.
I...
It was him. I know it was his breathing. I know it was his breathing.
Let me out of here! Somebody, please! [she struggles against her handcuffs and grunts] Let me out!
[stammering] You have to let me-
What?
What? 
Stop. I know who you are. I know what you've done. You took my boy away from me! You left him in that place to die! You faked his death! We had a funeral. We buried him. And now you're asking for my help? Go to hell.
[sighs] [gasps as Hopper is brought into the room she’s being held in – she’s released from her handcuffs and they’re both lead down a hallway] I don't understand.
What?
[stutters] But my son's in there. He-
Yeah.
[breathing heavily] Yeah. Yeah.
[echoing] Will! Will! [breathing heavily] Will! Will! [indistinct sobbing] 
[yelling] Will! 
Did you hear that?
Is that my house? 
Jonathan? 
This way.
[under breath] Oh, my God. 
[crying] Get him out! 
Okay. 
Okay. 
Okay. 
Okay. 
Come back to me, breathe. I need you to wake up now.
I need you to breathe. Please breathe! Please!
That's it. Oh, my God, that's it, that's it. 
Hey. Hi, sweetheart. 
Be careful. Be careful with him. 
What are you... What are you doing? 
Oh, why? 
They're so runny. 
An a-what-i? 
Really? Well... 
We'll have to see, won't we? Hey, no more snooping. 
Okay. [softly] He's washing his hands? [chuckles] 
Are you okay? 
No. What game? 
Wait, what is... You mean, this is..
Dungeons and Dragons. Right. 
[gasps] Yeah?
You saw who, baby?
Hey, is this where you saw him? [stutters] Is this where you saw Hopper?
[softly] Okay.
Okay, so... so Hopper is here?
Right.
[sighs] Uh, some... something about vines?
Hopper.
You know, I... We're fine, we don't need anything.
Those are great. Ah...
You know, he's sleeping.
[sighs] Listen, it's just not a good time. But, um, you know what? I'll call you, okay? Thank you.
Yeah.
[gasps] Bob!
Mmm-hmm.
I... I told you the rules. No questions, okay?
We... we just need you to help us figure out what... Bob? Bob? Over here. Where... where this is. That's the objective. Find the X.
Bob, no questions.
[stammers] Yeah. What's the problem, exactly?
Nothing. Nothing.
No. No! No. [scoffs]
What? What is it?
Hold on. Twenty-one feet, four inches.
[sighs and stammers] Danford? Where's Danford?
[sighs] Sixteen feet, ten inches.
Okay. Can't you figure it out?
[sighs] Thank you. Thank you.
Are... Are we close?
What's that mean, the vicinity?
But we did all that work.
What?
Where?
Are you okay?
Boys, I need you to stay here.
That's why I need you to stay here! Stay here! [gets out the car] Hopper!
Vines. Give me that.
Yes, give me the shovel.
[sighs] I need you to help me get down there.
Bob! Now!
[breathing heavily, now in the hole] Hopper! Hopper! Hopper!
[stammers] Bob, are you okay?
Hopper!
Hopper! Hopper!
Hopper!
Hopper!
Bob! Over here! [stammers] It's his. [sighs] He's gotta be this way. Come on. [grunts] Hopper! 
Hopper! Hopper! 
Oh! It's his arm.
Knife?
Okay.
[panting] Oh, my God. Hopper, are you okay?
Are you okay? Are you okay?
Oh, God!
Wait, wait, it worked?
So you remembered everything?
And you didn't yell at him?
Wait, a date? You never said anything about a date.
There's not.
I can't be out late.
8:00.
I'll meet you there.
Hello?
Hello?
Hello?
And what is this again?
It creates an electromagnetic field.
Yeah.
I... I don't see anything.
Yeah.
Just like my magnets.
Okay, why is nothing happening?
How...
No, no, no, I mean, how is this happening at my house?
And the magnets at Melvald's?
Apo-what-o-whah?
But what if... it's not?
A machine?
But it is possible.
God! Hold on, sweetie! 
I'm right here. Just hold on. 
That thing, it... it did something to him. 
Yeah. 
Or you. 
You cold? 
Okay. 
Yeah. 
Oh, it... it's not crazy at all. 
[gasps] Hey. 
Sweetie, how you feeling? You okay? 
What? What? 
Sweetie... 
That's enough. That's enough! 
Sweetie... Sweetie. It's okay.
What the hell is taking so long? [sighs] 
I need to talk to- 
You said that an hour ago.
What? What do you mean, sweetie?
Who? Who made you do what? 
What? No, be careful of the poster.
I can't eat.
(sniffles) Listen. Listen, the Xerox place opens in, like, 30 minutes.
And I don't want you to go alone... 
... so I'm gonna have Karen take you, 'cause I should be here.
We need to make, what, 200, 300 copies? How much is a copy?
Ten cents? (stammering) if we... Ten cents--
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
(sighs) We've been waiting six hours.
Six hours.
And?
God.
Oh, yeah.
The storm?
You're saying that that's not weird?
No. It was him. It was Will. (voice breaking) And he was scared. And then something--
No, Hopper, it was not a prank. It was him.
Come on, how about a little trust here? What, you think I'm... I'm making this up?
And you think I don't know my own son's breathing? Wouldn't you know your won daughter's?
No.
Oh, come on! You're wasting your time.
It was my son. I know it. And I... I heard something else.
It was like, uh, some kind of animal. I don't know. Just please tell Hop to hurry.
I'm not here to work. I... The storm last night, I... (sighs} I need a new phone.
Uh, yeah, you know, uh... I gave Jonathan all my money for... for the copies for the posters. Uh, I need an advance.
(softly) Thank you.
Yeah, uh, I was thinking, two weeks?
(picks up) Hello? Hello.
Who is this? Will?
Will, it's me. Talk to me. I'm here. Just tell me where you are, honey. I can hear you. Please.
Will!  Yes, it's me. It's me. Where are you? Where are you? Just talk to me-
Oh, no, no No! No! (sobbing) Oh, no! No, no... No! No!
Jonathan?  What...
Will...
Will... Will, is that you?
(breathlessly) Oh, my God. Oh, God... Oh, my God...
Hopper? Are you there?
We need to talk.
Just watch.
You slipped on this, remember?
Yeah, it fell in the night. It lost its magnetism.
And the same exact thing happened at my house the day before.
And I thought, "Okay, that's weird." Right? Why are all these magnets suddenly losing their magnetism?
So, I went and saw Scott.
Scott Clarke.
Yeah.
Oh, come on, Hop, you're not even listening to me. Scott was able to demagnetize some of the magnets, and he thinks-
He thinks that a large-scale magnetic field could be built using some sort of machine or- or experimental technology.
[scoffs] What if it's them? To build a machine like this, you need resources. You need scientists, you need funding, tens of millions of dollars.
It can't just be a coincidence, Hopper. It has to be them.
It has to be the lab.
Well, then, prove it to me.
Yeah, take me back there.
Yeah, I wanna go back.
Yes.
[scoffs] Thank you.
You know, after everything that's happened, this is no joke.
I need to borrow these.
[screaming] No!
No!
I'm fine.
I said I'm fine.
Will!
I feel like I'm losing my mind.
Yeah.
You mean... You mean, people like Scott Clarke. That was a joke.
What's that?
[looking around, clearly did not stay where she was like Hopper told her to do] Hopper! Hopper! Hopper!
Hopper! Hopper!
Oh! 
Can you just take Will, please?
[takes a second] Will you make sure he gets in okay?
Have a nice day. 
Mmm-hmm. 
No! No, you didn't. 
Yeah..
He likes you, too. 
Mmm-hmm. I can tell.
Your what? 
Oh. 
What? 
[chuckles] 
Yes, it does.
Bob, it's Joyce.
Bob, English. 
It's blue. I think it's working. 
[sighs] Come on, come on, come on! 
What? 
What? 
Hey, careful. 
Careful. 
Here. Hey. 
Oh. Here, here, here.
It's okay. 
That's it. Got it? 
Here.
A while. You've been drifting in and out. 
Slowly. 
What's the last thing you remember? 
Hey, you need to rest. 
No, you're not fine, Hop-
Um...
Uh... Uh... 
They were soaked. 
I mean, did you recognize him? 
The thug.
Well, I mean, he's gotta be government, right? 
Let's ask him. 
His license plate. 
Wait- 
Can't you run a search or something? 
Weeks? 
It wasn't a car.
[clears throat] Uh, what are you wearing? 
Get the hell out of my son!
You should sit down. 
Who you calling? The police? 
Have a nice day. 
Hold on a second. 
Anything? 
Hess Farm.
Our hands... our hands were almost touching. Now it's like I... uh... [sobbing] God, it's like I can't feel him anymore. [pause] Don't look at me like that.
Like how everybody is looking at me. Like I'm out of my damn mind.
[scoffs]
No. No, this is not that.
[sighs]
Well, they can't help.
[sniffles]
[sniffles and downs her drink, pours herself another]
Your dad's, uh, gonna stay here tonight. [stammers] On the couch.
[groans softly – doesn’t want to leave Will’s room]
[sighs]
I see Will the Wise is back. What's that shooting out of his cane?
Oh, well... if he's so wise, why does he need fireballs? Why can't he just, you know, outsmart the bad guys?
Yeah. So he needs the fireballs?
All right. Well, I don't know who's been raising you, but I'm gonna get you some new crayons because it looks like he's shooting cabbages.
[sighs] What are you doing? 
[noticing the lights are down] I told you not to take these down.
What?
You were here for the money!
The money! Admit it! You aren't here 'cause of Will. You never cared about him. You never did!
I can't believe I fell for this.
To help?
[stammering] Oh, like maybe to pay off your debts?
Oh, don't do that.
Lie to me!
Yeah, well, where does he wanna go?
Where does Jonathan want to go to college?
NYU, Lonnie! He's wanted to go to NYU since he was six years old!
Get out. Get out!
[laughs] Oh, brother, I have not needed you for a long time! 
[scoffs] Oh, don't you dare. At least I was here!
Maybe I am a mess. Maybe I'm crazy. Maybe I'm out of my mind! But, God help me, I will keep these lights up until the day I die if I think there's a chance that Will's still out there! Now, get out! Get out of my house!
Go away, Lonnie.
Seriously! I am gonna murd- [she opens the door only to see Hopper holding a sign that says “Don’t say anything”]
[whispers] What? What?
What the hell is going on, Hopper? 
What?
Who?
You gotta explain this to me, 'cause I am not-
What?
What?
Alexei…
…the generators, what are they powering? 
Hop, he did ask for cherry. I mean...
No, Hop- 
What are you doing? 
Uh... 
Hopper. 
Jim. Jim, move. 
Move, move, move! 
I thought you were fluent. 
Oh, what- 
So, this door is open now? 
[gasps] 
To call our children. 
You don't know it? 
So, now what? 
How long do we wait? 
How can you just sit there being calm? 
Our kids are in danger! 
Which is, like, ten minutes from the gate!
[scoffs] 
[on the phone] No. Don't you dare patronize me!
Thank you. And good day. 
That's one minute too long. 
Alexei. 
Hey, hey, hey! Wait up.
No. Your cheek.
All right.
Okay. Hey.
What happened here?
Hey.
You're our first customer, so...
What now?
Uh-huh?
Just take it down, Hopper.
That is not your decision.
Well, I mean, they're just kissing, right?
No, I didn't say that. I think you should... talk to them.
No. 
No. It only works if it comes from you. But...
Maybe I can help you… find the right words.
Eye contact.
Just keep going. Come on.
No looking. You know this. Come on.
“Share our feelings...”
Yes, it will! I promise. Oh, come on.
You got this. I promise.
Oh, I... Um...
Um, I... I have plans.
Oh, a customer.
Hey, Carol!
How are you? So good to see you.
Oh, my gosh, 13?
Hey, guys, I'm home. Guys? Hello?
Yes.
Me too.
Hey. Jonathan? Jesus, what... what happened?
Why is he wearing handcuffs?
Take them off.
Take them off!
What is this?
What?
What, you're sorry? You're... you're sorry? That is not good enough, Jonathan.
That's not even close. That's not even in the... in the ballpark. 
What if this thing took you, too? You risked your life... and Nancy's.
This is not yours to fix alone. You act like you're all alone out there in the world, but you're not. You're not alone.
God damn it, Jonathan.
Damn it
Is there any place that your... your parents don't know about that he might go?
Is there any way that you could... that you could reach Will? That you could talk to him in this-
Down. Yeah.
What? What's wrong? What happened?
Well... How do we make her better?
What?
I think so. Yeah. Yeah.
This will keep it dark for you. Just like in your bathtub. You're a very brave girl. You know that, don't you? Everything you're doing for my boy... for Will... for my family... Thank you.
Listen. I am gonna be there with you the whole time. And if it ever gets too scary... in that place, you just let me know, okay?
Ready?
 It's okay. It's okay. It's okay.
It's okay. It's okay.
Hey. It's okay. It's okay, we're right here. We're right here, honey. It's okay. I got you. Don't be afraid. I'm right here with you. I'm right here with you. It's okay. It's okay. It's okay. It's okay, you're safe. You're okay, honey.
You tell him... tell him I'm coming. Mom is coming.
Okay. Listen, you tell him to... to stay where he is. We're coming. We're coming, okay? We're coming, honey. 
Oh!
Oh, okay, okay. I've got you. It's okay. I got you. I got you. I got you, honey. You did so good. Are you okay?
 Uh, it's in the woods behind our house.
What, are you insane? No, I'm-
Yeah, but then I'll go. You stay.
He's my son, Hop. My son. I'm going! Now, listen, I need you to stay here...
...and watch over the kids.
Please, I need you to stay, Jonathan.
Please.
Please. I'm gonna find him. I'm gonna find him.
So this is your plan?
Well, did it? 
Will? Come on, honey, up and at 'em. Will? Jonathan?
Where's Will?
Where's Will?
No. Uh... 
Will? What are you doing?
[chuckles] Okay.
Okay. Let's get this... on. [grunts] Oh! You need some tape. Hold on. 
What's this?
Did you have another episode?
All right.
See? It's an exact match. But... why would he lie to me?
I mean, you heard him describe these episodes. It's not like he's describing a nightmare. He talks about them like they're real.
Then what the hell is this?
That place...
Well, there's that guy in Boston that's supposed to be-
Thank you.
Jesus! Hopper...
What?
Fifth and sixth period.
We ran. We just ran. [chuckles] God, I want this to be over.
Listen. Stay close to your brother, okay? And listen, listen, listen... If you get a bad feeling or anything, you tell him to take you straight home. You promise?
Be safe.
No. No, no.
No. No. No. [laughing]
I'm sorry. It's...
[sighs] I know. It's just every time he's away from me, it's like I can't function. I know it sounds silly.
What?
[sighs] Bob...
Oh, it's just so hard to explain. It's just this... This is not a normal family.
Still nothing?
Yes, we do.
Are we sure this thing is still out there, still alive?
Listen to me, I need to end this, but I will be back before you know it, okay?
No, listen. You're gonna be safe there. It's- It's far away from all this. You just stick close to your brother and- and do whatever he says. No matter what. Okay?
Oh, honey, I'm gonna be fine. Okay? I'm gonna be fine.
I'm gonna be fine.
What?
Yeah, well, change of plans.
Yeah. Will you explain it to him, please?
Yeah, and we wanna explode it!
Yeah, three.
And then we just follow the map to the observation room, turn the key-
Yeah. And then, once the rift is closed, we escape back through the vents.
Then home free.
Oh, God, just because it wasn't your plan doesn't mean it was a bad plan.
You made a noise.
You did too. I really think it's disrespectful...
Oh, my God.
What are you doing?
Why are you talking so much?
He was nice?
Yeah, I can bake him a casserole.
Smile and nod. 
It's fine.
Well, she's safe now. She's on her way to Murray's. That thing won't find her, not before we kill it.
Oh, yeah, and then you say something like... [as Hopper] "Yeah, well, it's really hard to listen when you make everything sound like it's the end of the goddamn world."
[clicks tongue and sits down] Well, we made it this far, didn't we? [sighs]
So, uh... did I get the job or what? Ah, come on. Detective Byers. It has a ring, doesn't it?
[sighs] Eh, we'll see how it goes. 
You know, if- if we actually do make it out of here, we- we deserve to celebrate, right?
I hear Enzo's is pretty good. What do you say, Friday, eight o'clock?
Okay, well, how about 7:00, then?
No, you pick me up.
Yeah, it's a date.
Yeah, Hop? Stop talking or I'm gonna change my mind.
Okay.
Okay. Six-six-two, six-oh-eight, oh-oh-four.
On three.
Come on!
[sobbing] Hop.
Thank God!
[looks at the teddy] Uh, yeah, sure.
Uh... It- It's the speech Hop wrote for you and Mike.
Yeah. You know, the heart-to-heart.
He never talked to you, did he? 
Are you okay?
Yeah.
Okay.
Look, we gotta go through this again.
Oh, gosh. Tell me again.
 Upstairs.
How do you know it was a kid's room?
So why would you think it was a kid's room, then?
You didn't say there was a drawing.
Was it good?
Wasn't Will.
Wait... Maybe, it wasn't?
Okay.
This is, uh... this is him. This is Will. Uh, you may have seen him on... on the news. Uh...
Isolation tanks?
Jane. Do you have any pictures of her?
Abilities?
(clears throat) What... what kind of abilities?
Do you think there is any chance she could be telling the truth? About having had the kid.
What?
Yeah, like Terry found her daughter? 
Twelve years? Twelve years she's been looking for her-
Okay. So, I'll pick you up in two hours. That's 9:00 on the dot, okay?
If anything happens, if you need to come home, just ask them to use their phone and call home. Okay? Don't-
Okay, but, sweetie-
Have fun.
Hey.
Hmm... I'll have to check in back.
Oh, shit! You're gonna get me fired.
Bob? Bob, I have to get back to work.
Come on. 
Bob, I have to get back to work.
Go sell your electronic thingamajiggies, and I'll see you tonight for movie night. 
Yes.
You feeling any better? Will?
Hey. What did we talk about, huh? You've got to stop it with the sorries. 
And listen, you know, there's nothing to be nervous about, you know. Just tell 'em what you felt last night and what you saw. Hey, I'm gonna be there the whole time. So it's gonna be okay. Okay?
Worse? He's already had two episodes this month.
What do we do when that happens?
I'm sorry, what you're saying is it's gonna get worse and worse and we're just supposed to pretend it's not happening?
"Trust me" Are you kidding me?
Don't call him that.
He's good. We're good.
Okay.
Stop. Stop!
Well, put the future down and get me a clean bowl.
Okay.
Did you hear that? 
[whispers] It's below us. 
Hopper!
Hopper! 
Oh, God. 
Are you kidding me? 
Shit! 
I'm trying! 
Hang on! 
Machina, machina, yes. 
Yes, machina- 
(to Alexei) Hold on, please. One minute. 
Yeah. 
Alexei. 
[sighs] It's not working. 
Shit!
I thought this friend of yours lived in Illinois.
Oh? Okay, well-
Easy. 
So we're walking to Illinois? 
Well, then what are we doing? 
I mean, fine. Just saying. 
Oh, my God. Can you not walk so close? 
Can you not walk so close to me? You stink. 
Yeah, with me in it. 
Oh, here we go. 
Whoa. 
He's running.
At the movies?
As long as there's a... a... 
Hey, what's going on?
Oh, yes, he- very dangerous, uh, forger... er.
Child murderer? 
I thought you said this guy was a journalist. 
Was? 
Alexei. 
Jim-
Hopper. 
[clears throat] Jim. C'mere. 
Just c'mere. I need to talk to you. 
This is not gonna work. 
He's not eccentric, he's certifiable. 
What? 
Oh, come on. 
No, no, no. 
What is your problem? 
No. (trembling) Whoever you found... is not my boy. It's not Will.
(stammering) No, you don't understand. I talked to him... a half hour ago. (sniffles) He was... He was here. He was... He was talking with these.
Uh-huh. One blink for yes, two for no. And... And, uh... (stammering) And then I made this so he could talk to me. 'Cause he was hiding... from that... that thing.
Yeah. Yeah.
No, maybe he's... It's after him! He's in danger. We have to find him! We-
Uh, no, it was... It was almost... human, but it wasn't. It... It had these long arms and... it didn't have a face. 
It didn't have a face...
No, you're... you're talking about grief. This is different.
No, I know what you're saying, Hop. (hoarsely) I swear to you, I know what I saw. (sniffles) And I'm not crazy.
No... (stammers) You are. (stammers) And I understand, but... God, I... I need you to believe me.
Oh, God.
(stammers) What... what time is it?
Go where? Where?
He has a birth mark on his right arm. Can you show that to me, please?
I don't... I don't know what you think that thing is in there, but that is not my son!
No!
No, I... (stammers) I need to think. Just go on home.
Just go home, Jonathan.
Shut down? What...
The funeral? For... for who? For that thing back there?
I know it sounds crazy. I sound crazy!
You think I don't know that? It is crazy! But I heard him, Jonathan He talked to me! Will is... is calling to me! And he's out there, and he's alone, and he's scared, and I... I don't care if anyone believes me! I am not gonna stop looking for him until I find him and bring him home. I am going to bring him home!
Come on! Come on! Talk to me! I know you're here!
Will?

Baby...

Listen to me! I swear I'm gonna get to you, okay? But right now, I need you to hide.

Lonnie.
What's going on?
What?
Okay, Will, Will, listen, listen. Do you know who I am? Do you know who I am?
Hold him down.

Fail secure?

Come on, Bob. Come on.
Bob! [panting] Bob.
No! 
No!
No!
Bob!
Bob! No!

No!
They're right. We have to kill it. I want to kill it.
I-
He knew who I was. He's still in there. It's gonna work. It has to.
Yeah.
Will, we just wanna talk to you. We're not gonna hurt you.
Hey. We wanna help you. But to do that, we have to understand how to kill it.
Do you know what March 22nd is? It's your birthday. Your birthday. When you turned eight, I gave you that huge box of crayons. Do you remember that? It was 120 colors. And all your friends, they got you Star Wars toys, but all you wanted to do was draw with all your new colors. And you drew this big spaceship, but it wasn’t from a movie. [stammers] It was your spaceship. A rainbow ship is what you called it. And you must have used every color in the box. I took that with me to Melvald's and I put it up and I told everyone who came in, "My son drew this." And you were so embarrassed. [chuckles] But I was so proud. I was so, so proud. 
Will, baby... if you're in there, just please... please talk to us. Please, honey, please, can you do that for me? Please. I love you so much. [breathing shakily]
You saw that little girl and she was in the sandbox and she was crying.
You gave her your Tonka Truck and I told you we couldn't afford to buy another one.
You said she should have it because she's sad. "She's sad, Mommy."
I love you so much.
So, so much.
Hey. Hey, can you hear me?
Oh, shit.
What?
