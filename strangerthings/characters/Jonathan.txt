Then we need to make the host uninhabitable. 
Are you sure this is a good idea? 
Mom. 
How much longer? Look... look at him! 
You're killing him! 
Mom you're killing him! 
Come on, buddy. 
Come on. Come on Will. 
[Jonathan joins the hug]
[panting] Close it. 
No, no. Just the good stuff. [chuckles] 
Yeah, yeah, it's what's happening. 
It's just the fireworks.
Nancy, shoot it!
Come on, come on, go!
[taking down the barricade] Hurry up! Come on!
Go!
Go, go, go, go!
Get in. Right here.
All right.
Like that thing in the hospital, only bigger.
Wait, you think Driscoll's in there?
We kill all the flayed.
Russians? Wait, what Russians?
Her leg, her leg. Okay.
Get that off.
Mom? Will? Hello?
Hey.
No, she was sleeping. But I left a note.
Stop saying that.
Yeah, I know. Just give him time.
What?
We're not together.
You still wanna do this?
Mom?
Mom, what is this?
What's going on?
He's trying to talk to you?
Mom-
It's the electricity, Mom. (stammering) It's acting up.
It's the same thing that fried the phone.
What? What about the wall?
Mom, first the lights, then the wall?
(sighs) No, Mom.
No, Mom. You don't need more lamps. You need to stop this, okay? He is just lost. People are looking for him, and they're going to find him. 
This isn't helping.
Can you do me a favor, Mom? Can you just try and get some sleep?
Huh? Can you do that for me?
Yeah?
All right, I'll go make breakfast.
Yeah?
What's going on?
(sighs) I don't know what you're talking about.
Hey. Please, give me my bag. No, just...
I was looking for my brother.
See, you can tell that he knows it was wrong, but... Man, that's the thing about perverts... It's hardwired into 'em. You know, they just can't help themselves.
No, please, not the camera. 
Mom? Mom, what happened?
It's okay. Hey.
Check the couch!
Yeah, see you later.
Oh, I didn't get him up yet. He's probably still sleeping.
Mom, I'm making breakfast.
He's not in his room?
I don't know.
No. (stammering) I got home late. I was working.
Eric asked if I could cover. I said yeah. I just thought we could use the extra cash.
I know, I know.
Mom, it's not a big deal. Look, he was at the Wheeler's all day. I'm sure he just stayed over
Will? (shouting) Will?
Will?
Will? Will!
Mom.
You have to stay calm.
Mom?
Cops.
If you found the bike out there, why are you here?
Yeah.
Nothing.
No. It's just... (voice breaking) I should've been there for him.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Dad?
It's Will?
Mom, it's Will?
What? What?
Hello? Hello, who is this? Hello? Who is this?
Mom, who was it? Who was it, Mom?
Look at me, Mom. Was it Will?
What did he say?
And was someone else there?
Mom, who was there? Who was it?
Remember...
Don't step on the trap.
Then... [flicks the lighter] All right. You ready?
On three.
One... two... [pause] You don't have to do this
I'm just saying, you don't have to-
Blink. Think of them as alarms. 
[stutters] No, it's fine. Thanks. Nancy? 
Yeah? 
You need to get out of here. [he grabs Steve]
Nancy.. 
Nancy. 
I don't know. I don't see it. 
No! [he grabs her and pulls her away] Go! Go! Run! Go! [Steve is standing in shock as the monster drops from the ceiling onto the ground but Jonathan tugs his arm] Get out of here! 
Jump! [jumps over the bear trap] 
I don't know. 
No. 
Come on. Come on, you son of a bitch. You see it? 
Come on. Where are you? Come on! 
He's in the trap! 
No. It has to be dead. [panting] It has to be.
Momâ€¦? 
Is that you? Mom. 
I don't think that's the monster.
Hey. 
You're home. You're home now. You're safe. 
Guys, guys. 
Go easy on him.
Will. 
Come on. 
So, you have fun? 
Hey, Mrs. Wheeler. 
Yeah, thank you. Uh, merry Christmas. 
So, uh, you win? 
Awesome.
[sighs] All right. Buckle up. 
Yeah, sure. 
[chuckles] Yeah. Yeah, pretty cool. 
What you got there? 
That one of yours?
Documenting. 
Because... 
It looks great. 
Mom. 
[chuckles] Mom, it's gonna be great. 
Thanks. 
Double.
Nance... Uh, on or off?
What?
Yeah.
What?
It's not going to end.
Yeah.
[chuckles] Congratulations.
What do you mean? 
[sighs] Yeah, Will needed me. And Steve...
Yeah, like, only a month.
Are you positive this is the right place?
All right.
What camera?
You might wanna sit down for this.
What? Think?
You don't believe us, do you?
This is ridiculous.
Wait. What?
Oh, come on! The light!
Look, I just... I just don't know if this is such a good idea anymore.
Look, all I'm saying is, what harm is there in asking? 
Or the old lady is nuts and the story blows up in our face and Tom fires us.
We're from The Hawkins Post.
You all right, little bud?
Uh... Yeah, okay, but, uh... I just think there's something really wrong with this rat.
No, I...
Nancy, wait up.
To taking down the man. 
Yeah, no. No, I've got to drive. 
I mean, do... do you want to stay? 
Okay. Uh... [stammers] Could I use the sofa? 
No, no. I mean, we're just friends. 
What? No, I mean, my dad's-
Steve. 
Trust issues? [scoffs] Trust issues. 
Trust issues? I do not... [grunts] 
Hey. 
Oh, no, don't I mean He's so drunk. 
Yeah. Yeah, it's fine. 
Yeah, um, good night.
Uh, sorry? 
Oh, yeah. Yeah, it was good. 
Oh, okay. 
It's not mine. Someone else has been here.
All right, Mom. Breakfast is ready.
Yeah, okay. All right.
I just need you to eat, Mom.
Yeah.
No, I know. I told you, I got it.
Okay.
Yeah, okay. Okay, Mom. Mom.
Mom. Mom. Mom! (stutters) You can't get like this, okay?
No, it's okay.
Can we, like, trace who make the call? Contact the--
Who would do that?
Hey, Hopper. Hopper
Let me go.
To Lonnie's. (stammering) You know, if Will's there, it means he ran away. And if he sees the cops, he'll think he's in trouble. He'll... He'll hide. You know, he's good at hiding.
Oh, hey.
Yeah.
Yeah. 
Thanks.
You like it?
All right, you can keep the mix if you want.
Yeah, really. All the best stuff's on there: Joy Division, Bowie, Television, The Smiths... It'll totally change your life.
Do you even like baseball?
Come on. Has he ever done anything with you that you actually like? You know, like the arcade or something?
No, all right? He hasn't. He's trying to force you to like normal things. And you shouldn't like things because people tell you you're supposed to. Okay? Especially not him. But you like The Clash? For real?
Hello?
Yeah, is Lonnie around?
To look around.
I'll be fast.
Hey, Will? Will! Will, you here? Will!
Get off!
Get off me, man.
Then why didn't you call Mom back?
This isn't some joke, all right? There are search parties, reporters...
What, you think I don't want to see you? I know you don't.
In case you forgot what he looks like.
Where are you?
You sure about this?
What's that supposed to mean?
Huh.
Okay.
Hey, it's okay. Nancy. Nancy!
Come on! What- [catches the rubber rat] What's this?
Proof?
A rubber rat?
Whoa, Nancy, slow down. Tom didn't ask for proof. He asked us to drop the story.
Nancy.
That's not the point.
You should've thought about that before you talked to them. All right? They're assholes, okay? I get it. But it's just some stupid story.
It's stupid to get fired over.
You're relentless, you know that? Come on. [grabs his jacket]
Oh, she must not be home.
Whoa, what are you doing?
Nancy-
Seriously?
We're looking, Mom.
He's staying over now?
Mad?
The people responsible for this... they're dead. 
Yeah. Why? What are you thinking? 
Uh... Mrs. Wheeler. 
Yeah. Uh, we have a test tomorrow. 
Bummer.
Yeah. 
Stressful. 
Bye, Mrs. Wheeler. 
[sighs] Okay, are you sure about this? 
Litigation? 
What? 
[chuckles] 
No. No, it's just kind of incredible.
But you refused, and now, I'm screwed. 
Yeah, yeah, those assholes gave us jobs. 
Neither do you. 
Yeah, I guess not.
What's going on?
[noticing the hole in the wall] What happened?
Mom... that thing you saw before, did it come back?
[sighs] Can we talk? Alone?
You need to leave.
Yeah. Well, you being here.. you're just making things worse, like always.
Yeah!
Yeah. Maybe he was.
[scoffs] Thank God you're here.
Ugh.
This is where we know for sure it's been, right? So, that's-
And that's the woods where they found Will's bike and... that's my house. 
Yeah. Exactly. I mean, it's all within a mile or something. Whatever this thing is, it's... it's not traveling far.
We might not find anything.
[sighs] We kill it.
Just give me a second. [he gets the gun and the ammo]
What? You want to find this thing and take another photo? Yell at it?
Yeah, well, it's the best we've got. What? You can tell someone, but they're not gonna believe you. You know that.
She's been through enough.
Yeah, and I'll tell her... when this thing is dead.
No, actually, you see the spaces in between the cans? I'm aiming for those.
You ever shot a gun before?
[chuckles softly] Yeah, I haven't shot one since I was ten. My dad took me hunting on my birthday. He made me kill a rabbit.
Yeah. I guess he thought it would make me into more of a man or something. I cried for a week. 
What? I'm a fan of Thumper.
Yeah. I guess he and my mother loved each other at some point, but...
...I wasn't around for that part. [Nancy takes the gun] Just, uh, point and shoot.
They must've married for some reason.
Screw that.
What?
Oh, uh... I don't know. My guess... I saw this girl, you know, trying to be someone else. But for that moment... it was like you were alone, or you thought you were. And, you know, you could just be yourself.
[stammers] What?
You know what? Forget it. I just thought it was a good picture.
[stammers] Okay.
Yeah, that's one word for it.
No, I... I never said that. 
Okay, all right. Does that mean I have to like him?
Listen, don't take it so personally, okay? I don't like most people. He's in the vast majority. 
Yeah?
Well, I was just starting to think you were okay.
I was thinking, "Nancy Wheeler, she's not just another suburban girl who thinks she's rebelling by doing exactly what every other suburban girl does... until that phase passes and they marry some boring one-time jock who now works sales, and they live out a perfectly boring little life at the end of a cul-de-sac. Exactly like their parents, who they thought were so depressing, but now, hey, they get it."
What, are you tired? 
What?
I'll do it.
I'm not nine anymore. [sighs] [cocks gun] [breathing heavily]
I don't know. Do you see any more blood?
[hearing Nancy] [gasps] Nancy! Nancy? Nancy? Nancy, where are you? Nancy! Nancy!
Nancy! Run! 
Hey! 
Come on!
Hey! 
No! Nancy!
[grunts] No, no! Nancy! 
Goddamn it! 
Nancy! Are you okay? Are you okay?
There is no next. 
What part of any of this makes sense? 
Wh... What's wrong?
What?
Oh, shit!
Whoa! 
Oh, no, I'll eat at work. I'm late.
All right, all right. I gotta run. See you later.
You mean we can't be late.
Hey, they like you too.
Okay.
Oh, no, no, no, no! Nancy!
I'm fine.
Why are you going through my car?
You won't believe me.
We don't know. 
I'm sorry, Mom.
I know.
I wanted to tell you, I just-
I thought I could save Will... I still do.
I know.
I know.
I might.
I don't know where he is, but I think I know how to ask him.
I got it.
Like a bad battery.
Hey, wait. It's not gonna snow next week, is it?
Even if we find Will in there... what are we gonna do about that thing?
He's my brother.
Yeah, he used to go there to hide.
No.
No, Mom.
I can help.
Please, be careful.
What?
You still wanna try it out?
Yeah?
What?
He's not in his room?
Three, two, one...
Great. Hold up the proton blaster. All right, now turn to the light.
Are you ready, bud?
I just don't get what she sees in him.
Bob.
What? You think I'm lame?
[sighs] Hey, listen.
If I let you go on your own, you promise to stay in the neighborhood?
And be back at Mike's by 9:00.
9:00.
Deal?
All right. Hey, Will. Don't let any of your spazzy friends use this, all right? [hands Will the camera]
[imitating Dracula] I hope it doesn't suck.
Huh?
Oh, uh, yeah. I'm going as a guy who hates parties.
Uh, Jonathan. [he sees Nancy and Steve dancing] Kiss? The band.
Keep her talking. Keep her awake, okay?
Okay. All right, El? This is gonna hurt like hell, okay?
[puts on gloves] Need you to stay real still. Here, you're gonna want to bite down on this, okay? [passes a wooden spoon]
Okay.
Stop talking!
Goddamn it!
It's big. [murmurs] Thirty feet, at least.
What's wrong?
[stops her] Whoa, whoa, whoa! Just stop, stop! Pop the hood.
What the hell?
The ignition cable's gone.
Go, go, go!
We don't need it to drive.
We just need the ignition cable.
Push!
Push!
All right, great. All right, now, all the way. Ready? Three, two, one... Push!
Uh, there should be a latch. Check under the wheel. You see it?
I don't know. It should be right here. Distributor, distributor...
Got it.
Oh, shit.
Go! Go, go, go, go, go, go!
Go, go, go!
Shit.
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. Come on.
Come on!
I don't think so. Hold on.
Whoa, whoa, whoa! Slow down.
Yeah, yeah.
I guess so. [sighs] Seventeen years of my life... packed up in one day.
I think... the new owners might kick us out.
Your dad'd love that.
Hey.
It's gonna be okay. [sighs and looks at their matching scars] As a wise man once said... we've got shared trauma.
[chuckles] What's a little more?
Nancy! (breathing heavily) Nancy!
I'm right here!
I'm right here! Nancy! Just follow my voice!
Follow my voice, Nancy, I'm right here!
Nancy!
Nancy? Nancy.
Nancy! Follow my voice!
Nancy?
Nancy!
I got you.
Better?
Is this okay? Uh, I found it in the closet. I can go home. I just figured-
No. Uh... no.
Yeah.
Do you want the lights off, or-
Yeah. You know, it... it can't get us in here.
Oh... Hey.
Couldn't sleep?
Hey. My mom said she talked to Will. If he's alive, there's a chance Barbara is, too.
You wanna go back out there?
Meaning it's... it's a predator, right?
Hmm, it was bleeding, too.
So you're saying it can detect blood?
But if it works...
Your mom doesn't knock?
And I'll have four boxes of the .38s.
Um...
"Monster hunting"?
You're shopping for bear traps with Jonathan Byers.
What's the weirdest part? Me or the bear trap?
What the hell was that?
What? What? Hey! Where are you going?
Nancy, wait!
Nancy!
Jesus.
Wait!
Come on, Nancy, let's just leave.
Get off!
You and your boyfriend have big plans, do you?
Thanks. 
Everything okay?
"Come and get sheet faced." No, I'm not.
Well, you can relax. I'm not gonna be alone. I'm going trick-or-treating with Will.
Yeah.
Sounds like a nice night.
Hey, bud. I didn't know what you'd like, so I got a variety. Take your pick. 
All right. What are you working on? Zombie Boy? Who's Zombie Boy?
Did someone call you that? Hey. You can talk to me. You know that, right? Whatever happened. Will, come on, talk to me.
What? Like what?
What are you talking about?
You're not a freak. 
You know what? You're right. You are a freak.
No, I'm serious. You're a freak. But what? Do you wanna be normal? Do you wanna be just like everyone else? Being a freak is the best. I'm a freak.
[chuckles] I have friends, Will.
Because you're my best friend, all right? And I would rather be best friends with Zombie Boy than with a boring nobody. You know what I mean? Okay, look... Who would you rather be friends with? Bowie or Kenny Rogers?
Exactly. It's no contest. The thing is, nobody normal ever accomplished anything meaningful in this world. You got it?
God, shut up!
Hello? 
Do you realize what time it is? 
What? 
Nancy, please tell me you're joking.
What? 
Uh... He's not even here. 
You waited all night to call?
Well, I'm here now, aren't I? 
Flayed? 
Oh.
You think they're guzzling this shit? 
I know. 
Where is she?
Are you sure this is the right room? 
Whose blood is that? 
Go! 
Go, go, go!
Run! 
This way, this way! 
Nancy! 
Hello? Hello?! 
Nancy? 
Nancy! Run! 
Mom, come on, please. You've gotta stop this.
Mom! Wake up.
It's almost 8:00. We have to go.
To see Will.
I don't know.
Since the first phone call, I guess. You know, she's had anxiety problems... in the past. But this... I don't know. (breathes deeply) I'm worried it could be... Ugh, I don't know. She'll be okay. We'll be okay. My mom... she's tough. 
Mom!
Mom, will you get in?
Mom, will you just get in, please? Mom. Mom Mom. Stop.
No, this is not an okay time for you to shut down.
We have to deal with this, Mom. We have to deal with the funeral!
Okay, let me get this straight. Will, that's not his body, because he's in the lights, right? And there's a monster in the wall? Do you even hear yourself?
Yeah.
(yelling) Yeah, well, while you're talking to the lights, the rest of us are having a funeral for Will! I'm not letting him sit in that freezer another day!
All right, show's over. What?
(stammers) Can you just give me a second?
Hey.
It looks like it could be some kind of perspective distortion, but I wasn't using the wide angle. I don't know. It's weird.
No. And she was there one second and then, um... gone. I figured she bolted.
What'd he look like?
This man you saw in the woods. What'd he look like?
Didn't have a face?
No, just that it came out of the wall.
Not long.
What?
Yeah. I guess I'd rather observe people than, you know... Talk to them. I know. It's weird.
It's just, sometimes... people don't really say what they're really thinking. But you capture the right moment... it says more.
What? 
I shouldn't have taken that. I'm, uh... I'm sorry. It's just-
My mom... I thought she was crazy 'cause she said... that's not Will's body. That he's alive. 
Then Barbara.
Why are the lights off?
Security took the night off? I don't think so.
No! The power's off.
What?
[whispering] Nancy, stay back. Hello? Who's there? Who's there?
Steve?
Why?
Hang on-
Come on! Get in!
I'm sorry, bud. Sorry I wasn't there. I should have been here.
You sure this is gonna work?
[breathing shakily] Do you remember the day Dad left? We stayed up all night building Castle Byers... just the way you drew it. And it took so long because you were so bad at hammering.
You'd miss the nail every time. And then it started raining, but we stayed out there anyway. We were both sick for like a week after that. But we just had to finish it, didn't we? We just had to.
Do you remember the first time I played you this? Mom and Dad were both arguing in the next room. So I played you the mix tape I made you. And it was the first time you got into music. Real music.
They're coming!
Come on.
Okay.
What?
