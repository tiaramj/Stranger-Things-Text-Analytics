Eleven? Hey. Um, I'm Max. I've heard a lot about you.
I thought that was the whole point.
Like she needs protection. 
Maybe we can draw them from the lab.
El would be at the gate. 
Billy, go away. 
Billy... 
Billy! Stop! Billy! Stop!
Steve!
Billy! 
What? 
Let's get out of here.
Everybody shut up! I'm trying to focus! 
What? 
What is this place? 
Dustin! 
You serious? 
Jesus, what an idiot. 
Ready. 
Dustin, get back. 
What was that?
Ow, ow. That hurts. 
Your hair. 
Are you trying to ask me to dance, stalker? 
Building something... Is he talking about the flayed?
Yeah, well, that's nice.
Where'd it go?
Holy shit.
Come on! Lucas!
Pull!
Oh, shit.
What- What- Hey, what are you doing?
No, first, we need to stop the bleeding, then clean, then disinfect, then bandage. I skateboard. Trust me. Mike, hold this.
Keep the pressure on it, nice and firm, okay? We're gonna need water, soap.
No. Go get me a washcloth and a bowl.
Lucas.
That doesn't look like a bowl.
You wanna kill that thing with fireworks?
Uh, yeah. Eleven.
Oh, my God.
[whispers] Quiet.
What?
You're positive he said "gate" and not "great"?
But if not, we always have Lucas' fireworks.
Ridiculous.
Those were Russians?
So this has nothing to do with the gate?
Will!
Okay, that totally freaked me out. Did that not freak you guys out?
What's True Sight?
This is so disgusting. Is this really necessary?
Oh!
You stink!
Hi.
Yeah, good luck with that.
What is wrong with me? What's wrong with you?
No! I don't understand! You guys act like you want me to be your friend but then you treat me like garbage!
Yes, it is! You go and hide in the AV Club, keeping secrets like we're in second grade or something. You know, I thought you guys wanted me in your party.
But what?
My own safety?
Because I'm a girl?
Did you keep secrets from El?
Did you?
Okay. You know what? Forget it, okay? I don't wanna be in your stupid party anyway. I'm out. Have a nice life.
You still stink, by the way!
He's no one.
This kid from my class.
It was just about a stupid class assignment.
I'm not!
Why do you care?
What would I ever do without-
Walking home. Yeah, yeah, I know.
What happened?
What is this shit, stalker?
A safe place to what? Be creepy?
Killed?
Oh, my God! This... this is so stupid.
Yeah. Sure. Fine. I accept the risk. Let's hear it.
Yeah. I mean, I bet. Wow.
It's crazy, but... I really liked it.
Yeah. Well, I mean, I had a few issues.
I felt it was a little derivative in parts.
I just wish it had a little more originality. That's all.
Lucas, come on, seriously How gullible do you think I am?
I don't know. To impress me or something? Or you're just, like, insane.
[chuckles] Risking your life?
Yeah. I mean... kind of funny. Stupid, but funny.
Story time's over, isn't it?
I wanted to be a part of the group, not a part of some joke.
You did a good job, okay? You can go tell the others I believed your lies if it gets you experience points or whatever.
Is that right? Then how do you explain this?
To protect me from who, exactly? The big bad government baddies from Hawkins Lab?
Maybe it was to protect me from the Demogorgon from another dimension?
Oh, no, no! You know what it was? It was Eleven. The girl-
You're serious?
Prove it.
So what? I'm supposed to just trust you?
Shit. I gotta go. Um... [holds Lucas' hand] Don't follow me out. Okay?
I'm not late.
Oh, Lucas?
[stammers] It's a small town, okay? We weren't hanging out.
I'm not lying.
Shit!
Hi?
He's a piece of shit.
Mike doesn't have jack shit to do today, and his Nana obviously isn't sick. I guarantee you, him and Lucas are playing Atari right now.
Yeah, well, boyfriends lie. All the time.
You're going to stop calling him. You're going to ignore his calls. As far as you're concerned, he doesn't exist.
He treated you like garbage. You're gonna treat him like garbage. Give him a taste of his own medicine.
Mm-hmm. And if he doesn't fix this, if he doesn't explain himself, dump his ass.
Come on.
To have some fun. There's more to life than stupid boys, you know.
So, what do you think? Hey, what's wrong?
Seriously? You have superpowers. What's the worst that could happen?
So, what should we do first? [laughs] You've never been shopping before, have you? Well, then I guess we're just gonna have to try everything. Ooh. Come on.
Do you like that?
You just try things on. Until you find something that feels like you.
Yeah. Not Hopper. Not Mike. You.
Come on! See? What'd I tell you? There's more to life than stupid boys.
You wanna trade?
Oh, you've gotta be shitting me.
Isn't this a nice surprise.
This is her new style. What do you think?
What is she, your little pet?
Okay! 
What are you doing here? 
What? 
What kind of proof? 
Mormons. 
It's kinda awesome. 
The fog, I mean. Looks like the ocean. 
What? 
No, no, no, it's not that. It's just... My dad's still there. So... 
[chuckles] Nobody actually says that, you know. 
And it makes you seem really cool. 
And I like talking with you, stalker. 
Wait. You sure that's not a dog? 
He's insane. 
Steve, hurry! 
Are they rabid or something? 
I don't know. 
[singing along] â™ª You must be an angel, I can see it in your eyes, Full of wonder and surprise...  [chuckles] Oh, you found Ralph Macchio.
Yeah, he's the Karate Kid. Hai-yah! [laughs] He's so hot, right? I bet he's an amazing kisser, too. Hey, uh... is Mike a good kisser?
Ex-boyfriend. Hey, don't worry about it. Okay? He'll come crawling back to you in no time, begging for forgiveness. I guarantee you, him and Lucas are, like, totally wallowing in self-pity and misery right now. They're like, "Oh, I hope they take us back."
God, what I wouldn't give to see their stupid faces. What is it?
Is this really gonna work? Holy shit, this is insane.
Yeah, quiet. I'm sorry.
What are they doing?
What?
What? [looks like she'll definitely punch one of the boys when she sees them next]
What happened?
What... What? What happened?
Do you knock? Jeez!
Mike's not here.
Yup.
Did you need something?
Holy shit, I can't believe we're really doing this. Ready?
Ugh. Boring.
Spin again.
We make our own rules.
Okay, look, I should just warn you, if he's with a girl or doing something gross, just get out of there right away before you're scarred for life. [grabs the radio and blindfold]
Okay, shutting up now.
What's he doing?
What is it? What happened?
It's gonna start pouring soon. We should be at the mall or, like, watching a movie or something.
I believe you saw some super weird stuff, totally, but you said Mike has sensed you in there before, right? So maybe it was just like that. Maybe Billy just... sensed you somehow.
Yeah, I know, but here's the thing. When Billy is alone with a girl, they make, like, really crazy noises.
Yeah, but, like... happy screams.
It's like... I'm just gonna lend you my mom's Cosmo. His car's not here. You really want to do this?
Why do I get the feeling we're gonna find all kinds of wrong in here?
[she opens a drawer and finds adult magazines] Ugh! Gag me with a spoon.
Ice. It's just ice. Probably for his muscles or something. He works out like a maniac
El, what is it?
Excuse me.
Yeah, we don't care. We're not here to swim. Or get electrocuted.
Does that belong to anybody here?
No. We're just... Good Samaritans.
Heather. Do you think you can find her?
What do you see?
What happened? El!
Is this it?
This is her house.
Heather's house.
We didn't mean to... barge in. We tried to knock, but... maybe you didn't hear us over the storm.
We just wanted to make sure everything was okay.
Your manager. At the pool. He said you guys didn't come in to work today, so we got worried.
After a week?
What? Okay, that's not funny.
Okay..
And he was in your trash? 
No, no. 
Pollywog? 
I know what a tadpole is. 
Maybe some scientists brought it here, and it escaped? 
I think you're an idiot. 
Dustin! 
Hello? Hello? Guys, come on. Can I come in yet? 
What the... 
What was that? 
What? 
What the hell are you doing? 
Looking for Dart. 
Yeah, so? 
Why do you hate me so much? 
But you don't want me in your party. 
Why not? 
El? Who's El? 
Someone or no one? 
Come on, you know you're impressed. 
If it's so easy, you try it. 
Why not? 
So, then you admit it's kind of impressive. 
I would give you a million bucks if you could. 
I'll stop when I join your party. 
It's a simple question. Am I in or out? 
Yeah, yeah. I think so. 
He said by Salerno's, right? 
(voice only) What happened? 
Which one? 
Hey, there's nothing to worry about anymore, okay?
What doesn't make sense?
What about him? 
Shut. Up. 
[scoffs] You've got to be kidding me.
I'm sleeping. Go away. 
What are you talking about? 
What? 
What does it feel like? 
Yeah. 
Whenever who was close? 
I don't know. He looks pretty normal to me.
I mean, it's a little weird. 
Okay, so we just... wait until he gets activated.
Seriously? 
(over the walkie) Mike, are you there? 
Where are you guys? 
God, I hope it's not you. I really hope it's not you. 
Do it. 
What's not your fault, Billy?
Who made you do it? 
What did he make you do?
Billy, it's gonna be okay. 
We'll figure it out together, okay?
I need you to trust me. Please. 
What? 
He can't get out, can he? 
What the f- 
Mike, you need to relax. 
No, I... 
No, enlightening her. 
Exactly, thank you. 
Exactly. 
We were just joking around. 
You weren't. 
Then gross! 
What's he doing now?
You mean El will kick their butts. 
What else do you see? 
It's California. It's a memory. 
Max. 
Where, El? Where are you? 
Excuse me, I'm sorry.
Oh, now that was mature.
Still made it. Fart face.
Thanks.
Come on!
Better?
What is wrong with you?
What's going on?
You know, I'm pretty sure people in Utah have telephones.
Oh, that's the Amish.
Shakespearean?
Right.
I got it.
It's romantic.
Yeah, only took five hours.
Did you seriously just drink the rest of our water?
Yeah.
Okay, sure. Yeah.
Yep.
Dustin, come on! She's not there.
Is that so?
Home.
Yeah, I know. The stalkers.
Is that why you're wearing proton packs?
"It'd be okay"?
Didn't realize it was such an honor to go trick-or-treating with you.
That's presumptuous of you.
Yeah, I had to get catch-up homework.
It's not that bad.
I don't see any cows.
No.
I'm not.
It's just we're stuck here, so...
Yours.
Nothing.
No.
Billy, slow down.
No! I don't know them.
No, Billy, stop. It's not funny.
Billy, come on, stop it. It's not funny. Stop!
Billy, stop it!
[takes off the mask, chuckling] Holy shit! You should have seen the look on your faces. And you? Who screams like that? You sound like a little girl. Hey, you guys coming or not? Oh, I heard we should hit up Loch Nora. That's where the rich people live, right? [chuckles]
No, I live up Old Cherry Road.
No, it's fine. I mean, the street's good for skating.
Stop. My ears are hurting.
What's wrong with him?
El beat the shit out of it, but, yeah, it's still alive. 
We cut the brain off from the body.
El, you're bleeding.
Here.
You're gonna kill him, aren't you?
What's she doing?
Mike.
No way, not with El's leg.
Shit!
Billy. Billy, you don't have to do this. Billy. Your name's Billy, Billy Hargrove. You live on 4819 Cherry Lane. Billy, please, I'm Max, I'm your-
Mike... Mike. [tries to wake him up] Mike. Mike. Mike. Mike, get up. Mike, can you hear me? Mike! Mike!
Hey, come on. You okay?
Billy!
Billy?
Billy. Billy, Billy, get up, please. Billy, get up, please, please.
Billy...
[shaking him] Billy. Billy. Billy, wake up. Billy, get up. Please, Billy... [sobs] Billy! Billy... [sniffles] Billy...
Wait, did we get that verse right? It's "unfold behind the clouds"?
Yeah, come on, Dusty-bun, why don't you join us? 
Can't we just hear your rendition?
Please? Just one verse?
It's Max.
Nobody calls me Maxine. It's Max.
Where is he? 
What are they doing? 
Does it still hurt? 
Doesn't matter. 
She's a lifeguard at the pool. 
Jesus, it's freezing.
But last year, Will didn't eat chemicals. Did you? 
Got it, two in a row.
Best three in a row now. 
He was tiny two days ago.
When's he gonna molt again?
Mews? Who's Mews?
Guys, who cares? We have to go.
[scoffs] A stranger?
No, no, no. Hey, guys, why are you headed towards the sound? Hello? Hello? Shit.
Guys?
Look out!
Demo-dogs?
Okay.
And so this virus, it's connecting him to the tunnels?
The what?
I thought we couldn't trust him anymore. That he's a spy for the mind flayer now.
I get why El was your mage now.
Lucas. He told me all about her.
Yeah, I know. I mean, why would you want a stupid zoomer in your party anyway? I'm just saying, El? She sounds like she was really awesome.
If he finds out where we are... will he send those dogs after us?
Yeah, but, if he does...
C.
Do you think he heard that?
Where are they?
Is it dead?
