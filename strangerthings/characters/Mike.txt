Eleven. 
Protecting her! Protecting her? 
So I should be thanking you? 
I don't! I don't understand! 
I don't blame her! I blame you! I blame you!
Liar! Liar! Liar! 
[crying] Liar! Liar!
Even if El can, there's still another problem. If the brain dies, the body dies. 
Closing the gate will kill him. 
We have to do it somewhere he doesn't know this time. 
Just be careful, okay? I can't lose you again. 
Do you promise?
Okay. 
Clear a path to the gate. 
We circle back to the exit. 
By the time they realize we're gone-
But-
This isn't a stupid sports game.
Get him! 
Get that shithead! 
Holy shit! 
Shit. 
dO I LoOk Like??]
Yeah, in a parking lot. 
I told you he'd freak out. 
Incredible. 
Yeah, I'm pretty sure it's this way. [looking at the crude map he drew] 
I'm 100% sure. Just follow me and you'll know. 
What? 
Dustin. 
Drench it. 
Yeah. 
Help! Help! Help! Help!
Help! Help! 
Don't. 
[whispering] Let's go. 
They're coming. Run! Run! 
Dustin! Come on! 
Eleven.
All right, that's enough. 
Why? 
Mom!
Holy shit. What happened to you? 
What? 
You look beautiful. Do you wanna dance?
I don't either. Do you want to figure it out? [she nods and Mike takes her hand] 
Yeah, but he's not building this army to spread.
Last year, El closed the gate on him. I have a feeling that really pissed him off.
And the Mind Flayer now knows that she's the only thing that can stop him. But if she's out of the way-
Yeah. That's good like that.
[grabs her] El!
El!
Pull!
Everybody out!
Drive! Drive!
Does that hurt?
You're gonna have an awesome scar. You'll look even more badass.
Yeah, bitchin'. [chuckles] El...
I've been meaning to tell you something. It's just, being broken up, it's been hard.
And... I like that you and Max are friends now. It's just, I was jealous at first, and- and angry. And that's why I said all that stupid stuff. And it's like I wanted you all to myself. And now I realize how unfair that is. And selfish. And, like... I'm sorry. I just, like, I've never felt like this, you know, with anyone before... and... [sighs] You know, they do say it makes you crazy.
You never- You never heard that term... You know, like the phrase, like... "blank makes you crazy," like the word...
No, no, no, no, not- not girlfriends.
No! No, no, not boyfriends either. It's like- It's like a feeling or... 
Yeah, like something... Like, old people say it to each other sometimes.
Yeah. What I wanna say is... that I just... I know that I-
Dustin?
Dustin!
Dustin, you're going way too fast. I can't understand you.
Dustin, you're- you're breaking up.
Dustin, you're cutting out.
Dustin, you there?
Dustin-
Dustin!
How do you even drink that?
You're insane.
What? No, I'm not talking about The Thing, I'm talking about New Coke.
Uh, actually, it's not the same concept.
No, it's not.
Sorry.
Did you... find him?
Which would explain how the Mind Flayer's still alive.
Yeah. Couldn't understand what you were saying.
El! El!
What's wrong? What's wrong? What's wrong?
El! El!
El! El, are you okay? 
El! El! El!
It's getting worse.
Do you like those grapes, Holly?
Stop being a baby and do it already!
What do you think? We're looking for Dart.
Ugh!
He'll be here.
We need to talk. AV room. Right now. 
[turns around] Party members only.
No! This is non-negotiable.
Will didn't want me to tell anyone, but on Halloween night he saw a sort of shadow in the sky.
I don't know. But it scared him. And if Will really has True Sight... I mean, if he can really see into the Upside Down, maybe he saw that shadow again yesterday.
Maybe.
I'm not sure. Dustin?
Yeah, if that's even what's happening. This isn't D and D. This is real life.
We acquire more knowledge. I'll go to Will's after school. See what's going on. You guys stay here and find Dart.
Will heard him in the Upside Down. I don't know how yet, but he's gotta be connected to all this. He's gotta be. If we find Dart, maybe we can solve this thing. Maybe we can help Will.
Hello? Will! Mrs. Byers?
[sighs] Hey.
Is Will here?
Is he okay?
It's about the shadow monster, isn't it?
We just tell our parents we have AV Club after school. That'll give us at least a few hours for Operation Mirkwood.
Just trust me on this, okay? 
Did you get the supplies?
(sighs) Dustin, what did you get?
She's not a dog!
Just stay down here. Don't make any noise, and don't leave. If you get hungry, eat Dustin's snacks, okay?
Coming! You know those power lines?
Yeah. The ones behind my house?
Meet us there, after school.
Yeah, Ah. 
When the numbers read three-one-five, meet us there. 
Three-one-five.
How about this one?
Why does that matter? The X-Men are weirdos.
What are you talking about?
What?
Shut up, Lucas.
Yeah. 
Yeah.
Yeah, this is it.
El! (panting) You okay?
Hop on. We only have a few hours.
What? Oh, that. Uh... I just fell at recess.
I was tripped by this mouth breather, Troy, okay?
Yeah, you know... a dumb person. A knucklehead. 
I don't know why I just didn't tell you. Everyone at school knows. I just didn't want you to think I was such a wastoid, you know?
Yeah?
Oh. Okay, cool. Cool.
Yeah, this is where Will lives.
No, no, this is where he lives. He's missing from here. Understand?
She said he's hiding here.
Why did you bring us here?
What do you want to do then?
We are not calling the cops!
Will...
It's not Will. It can't be.
"Mike"? "Mike," what? You were supposed to help us find him alive. You said he was alive! Why did you lie to us? What's wrong with you? What is wrong with you?
What?
Something is coming. Something hungry for blood. A shadow grows on the wall behind you, swallowing you in darkness. It is almost here
An army of troglodytes charge into the chamber!
(softly) Wait a minute. Did you hear that? That... that sound? Boom... boom... (yells) Boom!
That didn't come from the troglodytes. No, that...that came from something else. The Demogorgon!
Will, your action!
The Demogorgon is tired of your silly human bickering! It stomps towards you. Boom!
Another stomp, boom!
He roars in anger!
Oh, shit!
Mom, we're in the middle of a campaign!
Mom, wait, just 20 more minutes.
But that'll ruin the flow!
I'm serious, mom. The campaign took two weeks to plan. How was I supposed to know it was gonna take ten hours?
Dad, don't you think that 20 more--
She's always been a real jerk.
Four years ago!
Huh?
You're disgusting.
That's weird. I don't see him.
I think it's kinda cool. It's like you have superpowers or something. Like Mr. Fantastic.
So, did it come?
Yes!
Whoa.
Australia?
(Australian accent) Hello, this is Mike Wheeler, president of Hawkins Middle AV Club.
Mirkwood.
Yeah.
Shut up, guys!
Mirkwood, it's a real road. It's just the name that's made up. It's where Cornwallis and Kerley meet.
We can show you, if you want.
We can help look.
Stop it!
We should be out there right now. We should be helping look for him.
I don't care what the chief said.
We have to do something. Will can be in danger.
Mom!
Wait, this is Will's fault?
You're just pissed off 'cause you wanna hang out with Steve.
Her new boyfriend.
(shouts) What happens when what? I'm the only one acting normal here! I'm the only one that cares about Will!
Lucas, do you copy? It's Mike. Lucas?
I know it's you. And say "over" when you're done talking so I know when you're done. Over.
I'm worried about Will. Over.
I was thinking... Will could've cast Protection last night, but he didn't. He cast Fireball. Over.
My point is... he could've played it safe, but he didn't. He put himself in danger to help the party. Over.
No. We're not going back. Just stay close. Come on. Just stay on channel six. Don't do anything stupid.
Will! Will!
Dustin, shut up.
Shut up. Shut up.
Did you guys hear that?
Nancy? Jonathan?
They're gone.
Nancy and Jonathan. His car's gone.
No. No way! 
I don't know. 
What? Did you see them? Do you know where they went? 
Where? Where did they go?
Guys, guys! This is crazy. We can't just wait around. 
El can find them..
Well, where are you going? You just said stick to the plan! 
Are you serious?
What? No, no. [scoffs]
Because... [sighs] 'cause it's different.
Yeah?
Nancy. Hold on, I'll be right back. Stay here. [Mike goes outside, expecting to see Nancy, but instead he's faced with the small army of armed agents from Hawkins lab - he runs back inside]
Guys! Guys! [Mike runs back into the cafeteria]
[panting] They found us.
I don't know, but they knew we were in the gym. 
Go, go, go, go, go! 
Back! Go back! 
Go, go! Go left! 
El, are you okay? El! Something's wrong. 
No, no, no, she won't wake up. El! El! El!
She's barely breathing. 
No! You want her, you have to kill us first. 
Oh, no! No, no! 
[screaming] You idiot! 
Ow! Let go! 
Get off of me. [grunts] 
Let her go! Let her go, you bastard! 
Blood. 
Blood. 
Come on, come on. 
Come on, come on! 
[sniffles] Promise. 
Go, go, go, go!
Go, go, go, go, go! 
Go, go, go.
Get the rocks, get the rocks, get the rocks! 
Go! Go! Kill it! Kill it! 
Kill it! Go, go, go, go! 
Hit him again. 
Keep going! Come on! 
Come on! Go, go, go! 
Eleven, stop! [gets tossed back by Eleven’s powers, screams]
El? El? El! 
El! El, where are you? Eleven! El?
Guys. Guys, he's up. Will is up. Guys, Will's up. 
Guys, come on. [they run to see Will] 
Byers! 
You okay? 
More like a Yoda. 
Yeah, it flipped over us
It was pouring out of their eyes. 
The thessalhydra! 
It roars in anger! Will, your action! 
No, there's a medal ceremony-
And-
It was ten hours! 
I don't know, it's-
See you, Will. 
Like in the Upside Down?
Here, like, in this house?
And the more you see these now-memories.
Maybe... Maybe that's good.
Just think about it, Will. You're like a spy now. A superspy. Spying on the shadow monster. If you know what he's seeing and feeling... maybe that's how we can stop him. Maybe all of this is happening for a reason.
Yeah. Yeah, I really do. 
He won't.
We won't let him.
Will, what's wrong?
Here!
Did he say anything? I mean, before he left?
I'm not sure. Mrs. Byers?
There's nothing. There's nothing here.
Superspy.
Do you see anything? I mean, in your now-memories?
Will? Will, you okay? Will, what's wrong?
Okay! Hello?
Sorry, I-I was just about to call. I, um... can't see you today.
It's my Nana. She's very sick.
Yeah. That's... what... we thought it was at first, but then she took a real turn for the worse.
Yeah. We think she might... die.
Mom! Get off the phone! How many times?!
No, Mom! Just get off the phone!
[sighs] Sorry about that.
Yeah. She's so upset, she's making no sense. Because we have to go to the nursing home. To see Nana.
What? No. Friends don't lie. What, Mom? My mom's calling me. Better go. Talk to you tomorrow. Talk you already. Bye!
She knows I'm lying. She knows I'm lying.
Hopper. He threatened me.
What? No.
The big deal is if I don't do what he says, then he'll stop me from seeing El. Like, permanently. You don't understand, Lucas. He's crazy. [sighs] He's lost his mind.
I had no choice, Lucas. I really had no choice.
How?
I just... I don't understand what we're looking for.
What, just something that literally says "I'm sorry"?
Excuse me, sir.
How much for this little teddy bear right here?
I should've shoved that teddy bear right up his-
Oh! Uh! Ahh!
No.
That's ridiculous. Why can't I just...
Okay, what if we split it?
What are you doing here?
What's wrong with you? You know she's not allowed to be here.
What? No!
What?
She is. She is. She is sick. Yeah, sick- she's sick.
Yeah, we're shopping. Not for us, but for her, for Nana.
Also, we're here to get a gift for you. Just, we couldn't find anything that suited you and I only have, like, $3.50, so it's hard.
Will. Will? Will? What's wrong? Are you hurting again?
In your now-memories? 
The spy. 
The spy! [gets up and runs out of the room]
Is there a number we can call for your parents?
Are you in some kind of trouble?
Stop it! You're freaking her out!
All right, that's enough, all right? She's just scared and cold.
Here, these are clean. Okay?
No, no, no!
See over there? (stammers) That's the bathroom. Privacy. Get it? You don't want it closed?
Oh, so you can speak. Okay, well... Um, how about we just keep the door...
Just like this. Is that better?
At least she can talk.
From where?
So you just wanted to leave her out in that storm?
Who's crazy now?
'Cause, we weren't supposed to be out tonight, remember?
So if I tell my mom and she tells your mom and your mom...
Exactly. We'll never find Will. All right, here's the plan. She sleeps here tonight.
Just listen! In the morning, she sneaks around my house, goes to the front door and rings my doorbell. My mom will answer and know exactly what to do. She'll send her back to Pennhurst or wherever she comes from. We'll be totally in the clear. And tomorrow night, we go back out. And this time, we find Will.
Here you go. This is my sleeping bag.
Hey, um, I never asked your name.
Is that real? Sorry, I've just... never seen a kid with a tattoo before. What's it mean? Eleven? That's your name? Eleven. Okay. Um, well, my name's Mike. Short for Michael. Maybe we can call you "El." Short for Eleven. Um, well, okay. 'Night, El.
Do a lot of studying last night?
What was your test on again? Human anatomy?
Hey, you found my supercomm. Pretty cool, huh? I talk to my friends with it. Mostly Lucas, 'cause he lives so close. Signal's pretty weak. Got you breakfast. So listen, this is gonna sound a little weird, but I just need you to go out there. Then go to the front door and ring the doorbell. My mom will answer and you'll tell her that you're lost and that you need help. But whatever you do, you can't tell her about last night or that you know me. Understand? Really, it's no big deal. We'll just pretend to meet each other again. And my mom, she'll know who to call.
No?
Bad? Bad people? They want to hurt you? The bad people?
All right, I'll be back. Just stay here, okay? Stay here.
You want anything to drink? We have OJ, skim milk... What else? Um, we have... Oh, this is my living room. It's mostly just for watching TV.
Nice, right? It's a 22-inch. That's, like, ten times bigger than Dustin's.
I guess. That's my sister Nancy. And that's baby Holly. And those are my parents. What are your parents like? Do they live close?
Just trust me, okay?
See? Fun, right? Now you try.
(mimicking Yoda) Ready are you? What knows you of ready?  His name's Yoda. He can use the Force to move things with his mind, like this. Whoosh! Oh, this is my dinosaur, Rory. Look, he has a speaker in his mouth so he can roar.
You know Will? Did you see him? Last night? On the road?
We gotta go.
Just me, Mom!
One second! In here. I'll be right back, okay?
Please, you have to get in, or my mom, she'll find you. Do you understand? I won't tell her about you. I promise.
It means something that you can't break. Ever.
Please?
I just... I don't feel good. I woke up and my head, it really hurt bad, and my throat was all scratchy, and I wanted to tell you, but the last time I told you I was sick you made me go to school anyway, and-
Yeah?
No?
No.
Eleven? Is everything okay? El?
Is everything okay?
Are you sure?
Just listen to me.
She knows about Will.
She pointed at him, at his picture. She knew he was missing. I could tell.
Just think about it. Do you really think it was a coincidence that we found her on Mirkwood, the same place where Will disappeared?
And she said bad people are after her. I think maybe these bad people are the same ones that took Will. I think she knows what happened to him.
Stop it, you're scaring her!
No! Eleven said telling any adult would put us in danger.
El for short.
Danger danger.
No!
(looks at Dustin) Nice.
El? No adults. Just us and some meatloaf. Don't worry. They won't tell anyone about you. They promise. Right?
What Dustin is trying to say is that they were just scared... earlier. That's all.
Is someone that you'd do anything for.
And they never break a promise.
That's super important, because friends... they tell each other things. Things that parents don't know.
El?
Did you see him? On Mirkwood? Do you know where he is?
I don't understand.
Will is hiding? From the bad men?
Then from who?
What's wrong with me? What did I do wrong?
What did I do wrong? What could I have done wrong?
I just don't understand what I did to deserve this.
I know. It's just, why is she treating me this way?
What did I do wrong? What did I do wrong?!
I know, I know, you're right.
Because women act on emotion and not logic.
Yeah, we're trying to solve the great mystery of the female species.
[chuckles] Dude, you can smell the nacho cheese.
What?
No! Lucas! Lucas!
Yes! [groans as he and Lucas wake up]
Yeah, Will, can you turn down the music?
What?
Oh, my God. Okay, Will the Wise, can you please turn down the music?
Will, come on.
Will, it's so early.
What should I do?
Okay, I attack with my flail. [rolls dice]
[sarcastically] Oh, no, my arm. Lucas, look, my arm.
El? No. Sorry, not interested. Telemarketers. 
We can do that?
Yeah, but what would we say?
All right, then. I'll use my torch to set fire to the chambers, sacrificing ourselves, killing the jujus, and saving the Khuisar. We all live on as heroes in the memories of the Kalamar.
Will, I was just messing around. Hey, let's finish for real. How much longer is the campaign?
No, you want to keep playing, right?
We'll just call the girls afterwards.
But...
Will, come on. You can't leave. It's raining. Listen, I said I was sorry, all right? It's a cool campaign. It's really cool. We're just not in the mood right now.
That's not true.
El's not stupid. It's not my fault you don't like girls.
I'm not trying to be a jerk. Okay? But we're not kids anymore. I mean, what did you think, really? That we were never gonna get girlfriends? We were just gonna sit in my basement all day and play games for the rest of our lives?
Will. Will! Will, come on!
Will! Will, I'm sorry, man, all right? I was being a total asshole. Please, can you just come outside and we'll talk? Will!
Something is coming, something hungry for blood.
Will, your action!
Direct hit! Will the Wise's fireball hits the thessalhydra!
Will!
What happened? Are you okay?
Why?
D'Artagnan? 
What is he? 
He's not gonna steal your discovery. 
I told him to stop. We need to go. 
Right now. Right now! 
No! , 
What do you not understand? 
But then he heard it yesterday. The exact same sound. 
Dart is from the Upside Down. 
I agree. 
Maybe he should be dead. 
How can you not? He's from the Upside Down. 
A bond? Just because he likes nougat? 
Only if he attacks. 
Oh, shit! 
Dart! 
You let him escape! 
Come on. [runs after Dart]
What are you doing? Why are you in here? 
This is the boys' room. 
Correct. 
Someone. No one. 
That's not even a real thing. 
Mind-blowing. 
No.
I don't know how. 
Okay, you're making me dizzy. Please just stop. 
Come on, just stop. 
Jesus! Are you all right?
Copy that. 
Let's go. Down here. 
Where's Dart? 
What? 
Where is Will? 
Just come over to my house. We'll explain everything. 
Hurry.
Try Dustin again. 
So, try him again. 
Power went out that night, too. 
Sure. 
No. What if he hurts someone? 
I have an idea. Boys only. 
Just trust me on this one.
get him into here.
And look, the controls are right here. It's perfect. 
What? 
What are you talking about? 
Yeah! 
I'm coming. Just... hold on a second. 
Shit! 
Billy! 
[in sing-songy voice] Billy! 
Billy! Billy! 
Billy. Come and find me. 
Come and get me. Come on!
Billy! 
Come and get me, you piece of shit. 
[on radio] Hey. Behind you. 
Now! 
Come on.
Max, get away from the door. 
Get away from the door! 
Go to hell, you piece of shit! 
What was Will saying? Like home... Like home... but dark? 
Like home. Like his house? 
Upside down. 
Upside down. When El showed us where Will was, she flipped the board over, remember? [he demonstrates] Upside down. Dark. Empty.
Guys, come on, think about it. When El took us to find Will, she took us to his house, right?
But what if he was there? What if we just couldn't see him? What if he was on the other side? What if this is Hawkins and... [he flips the board upside down] this is where Will is? The Upside Down.
An alternate dimension. But... how... how do we get there?
Do you know how we get there? To the Upside Down?
Ah! Dad, you're... you're choking me. 
“I don't know!” , , [Will distorted] Mom, it's coming! , ,
Mr. Clarke? 
We were wondering if you had time to talk?
A lot of questions.
So, you know how in Cosmos, Carl Sagan talks about other dimensions? Like, beyond our world?
Right, theoretically.
Yeah, exactly. If that did exist, a place like the Vale of Shadows, how would we travel there?
Right. 
But we're not the flea, we're the acrobat.
But... but what if this gate already existed?
[having just shown El the diagram Mr. Clarke showed them] It would take a lot of energy to build a gate like this. But that's got to be what happened. Otherwise, how'd Will get there, right?
Dustin, what are you doing? Dustin? Dustin!
What?
What's exciting about this? , ,
What do you mean?
So what you're saying is the compasses are broken. , ,
No.
It could disrupt the electromagnetic field.
Yeah?
What? Why?
[sighs] Look, I'm sure we're almost there. Just hold on a little longer, okay? 
What?
[sighs] Maybe the gate moved.
Maybe it's something here.
Why would she do that?
Lucas, what are you doing? 
Lucas, come on, seriously, just leave her alone!
Lucas, come on!
Bull! That's old blood. Right, El? Right, El?
That's not true. She helped us find Will!
Yeah, you know what I mean.
Screw you, Lucas!
Shut up!
Shut up. 
I said shut up! 
Lucas! Lucas! Lucas, are you all right? 
Lucas, wake up! Lucas.
Why would you do that?
What's wrong with you? [distorted] What is wrong with you?
Lucas... Lucas, come on!
Lucas. Lucas, you okay?
Let me see your head.
Just... Lucas. Lucas, let me see.
Lucas, come on.
Where is El? El? El!
El! Eleven!
Eleven!
Stairs. 
Jesus! 
It can't be good for her to be in there for this long.
What if she gets brain damage or something? 
Oh, and you do? 
The way that you frame that is such bullshit. 
Yeah, because she is conspiring against me. 
She's corrupting her.
She's risking her life for no reason.
Oh, she didn't tell you this? 
Your girlfriend used El's powers to spy on us. 
Yeah. I guess girlfriends don't lie, they spy. 
But what if I was?
Nothing. Nothing. 
It's a trap, I agree. We'll be ambushed. 
It's too risky.
Yeah, but- 
We don't know that. 
Yeah. Just... be careful.
Something's wrong. 
[echoing] El, are you okay?
Are you okay? 
What's going on? 
El, El, we found it. Get out of there. Get out.
El, you're okay. It's- It's okay. El. 
♪ And nobody wants to know you now ♪
♪ Nobody wants to show you... ♪
♪ You can never surrender ♪ 
What, you don't like it?
What's wrong?
My God, that was priceless! Did you see his face?
Yeah, a fat tomato. {uncalled for}
Sorry!
Yeah, if you keeping whining about it. Let's go!
Just please stop talking, dude.
Oh, yeah, real mature, Lucas.
Lucas, stop.
Excuse us! Sorry! Sorry!
All clear.
See, Lucas? We made it.
Come on!
Hey.
You okay?
Are you sure?
Okay.
[whispers to El] Now!
What exactly are we looking at here?
Wait, so her name is Suzie?
Hey, guys! This is fun and all, but, uh...
Sorry, man. Curfew. [to El] Come on, let's go.
What?
Is everything okay?
Is she dead?
Did she fall again?
Does she have cancer?
Then I don't understand. What's wrong with Nana?
What?
Oh, you lying piece of shit!
You're crazy!
You don't need it.
Yeah! Pretty. Really pretty. El?
Um, I'm happy you're home.
Me, too.
Yeah.
What's he saying?
Lucas, if you can hear us, slow down. We can't understand you.
"Bad men." Bad men!
Stay here.
What's that guy doing?
Mom!
Mom!
Did you schedule any repairs?
Is there anyone supposed to come and do repairs on the house?
No, Mom, nothing's wrong in the house.
One second.
If anyone asks where I am, I've left the country.
Okay.
This way, come on!
Lucas! 
I don't know.
Go, go, go, go, go!
Go, go, go, go, go! Faster, faster!
No, Dustin, we missed it.
Me, too.
It means government. Military.
Just trust me, all right? It's military. My dad's told me before.
No, weapons... to fight the Russians, and commies and stuff.
I don't know, but we can't go home. We're fugitives now.
Go, go, go, go!
Hurry up! Hurry, come on!
Don't answer.
What if it's a trick?
What if the bad people kidnapped her? What if they're forcing her to say this?
Yeah, I copy. It's Mike. I'm here. We're here.
Will you stop pacing?
Go, go, go, go.
Both of you, shut up.
Yeah, uh... me, too.
Okay, so, in this example, we're the acrobat. Will and Barbara, and that monster, they're this flea. And this is the Upside Down, where Will is hiding. Mr. Clarke said the only way to get there is through a rip of time and space.
He's seen it.
Whenever she uses her powers, she gets weak. 
But she's drained.
We don't. We just have to wait and try again.
I don't know.
Ah...
Huh?
Whoa.
What?
Oh. Candy, leftovers, Eggos... She really likes Eggos.
Okay. Do you like Jonathan now?
What? No. Ew. Gross.
I don't know.
I told you everything.
I don't know where she is. And even if I did, I'd never tell you. I would never tell you.
All right, that's the last one.
Can I go to school?
No!
Hey, Spengler!
Whoa! Whoa!
Why are you Venkman?
No, I'm Venkman.
Because there's only one Venkman in real life. We planned this months ago. I'm Venkman, Dustin's Stantz, you're Egon, and you're Winston.
Yes, you did!
What's wrong with Winston?
Yeah, but he's still cool.
I can't!
[stutters] Because...
I didn't say that!
I didn't say that!
Just be cool.
Don't you love me?
Erica, I am this way because of you.
Mmm-hmm. You have made me wild and impetuous, just like you.
They're gonna love it.
Erica, tell me that you will marry me, in this house, tonight...
Awesome!
No one likes 3 Musketeers.
Oh, God. Give me a break.
[sighs]
Did you agree to this?
To her joining our party.
You should have checked with me.
She's ruining the best night of the year.
Will!
Will, what's wrong?
I couldn't find you. Are you hurt?
I don't know. I'm gonna get you home, okay? I'm gonna get you home. Hold on.
I got him.
Keep trick-or-treating. I'm bored anyways.
Like, like, stuck in the Upside Down?
Caught between two slides?
The Demogorgon?
Is this all real? Or is it like the doctors say, all in your head?
Eleven would.
Yeah. She always did. Sometimes I feel like I still see her. Like she's still around, but she never is. I don't know. Sometimes I feel like I'm going crazy.
Hey, well, if we're both going crazy, then we'll go crazy together, right?
It's day 353. I had a bad day today. I don't know. I.. I guess I wish you were here. I mean, we all do. If you're out there, just please give me a sign.
Eleven?
There's something in there.
Do it.
The Mind Flayer, it built this monster in Hawkins, to stop El, to kill her and pave a way into our world.
Could've used you up here, too.
Hey. We should probably go.
Are you okay?
Okay.
Here.
Lay down.
Be careful!
Scoops Troop, do you copy? Scoops Troop, I repeat, do you copy?
We're trapped in the mall and in need of emergency transportation.
Scoops Troop, do you copy? Billy has found us. He has disabled our car and we are trapped in the mall. Repeat: Billy has disabled our car and we are trapped in the mall.
Scoops Troop...
Scoops Troop, I repeat, we are in need of emergency transportation. Do you copy?
Scoops Troop, do you copy?
Steve, do you copy?
Dustin!
[panting] El...
Told you. Physics.
[echoing] El.
Are you okay?
Nancy!
Come on!
It's turned away. If we go up the stairs now, we'll make it.
We have to try.
[panting] [whispers] Okay. Now.
Let's go.
Go, go, go, go, go, go, go!
In here. In here. Okay. Come on, come on, come on...
Where's El?
El.
Whoa, dude. That's the donation box.
Yeah, but what if you want to join another party?
They'll come back. I know they will.
You packed your walkie, right?
Because you know that I'm gonna steal Cerebro from Dustin and call you so much, you're gonna have to turn it off, right?
Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I got the okay. I'll be there. And then I was thinking maybe you could come up here for Christmas. And Will, too. You can come before or after Christmas, or whatever Mrs. Byers wants, but I was thinking Christmas Day could be super fun, because we'd all have cool new presents to play with and, uh... [chuckles] Sorry, that made me sound like a seven-year-old.
Yeah, cool. Yeah. I like- I like presents, too.
Yeah?
Um... I don't think I follow.
Oh. Oh, yeah, that. Man, that was so long ago. Um... That was really heat of the moment stuff, and we were arguing and... I don't really remember... What did I say, exactly? [definitely remembers but wants to see cool I guess]
I just... I can't believe she didn't come back.
She said it wasn't safe. She just messed up the compasses because she wanted to protect us. She didn't betray us.
I shouldn't have yelled at her. I never should've done that.
Yeah, it's Lucas'.
It wasn't his fault?
So you're saying he wasn't way out of line?
What?
Oh, give me a break!
No, I'm not.
No.
Where are we going? 
I drew first blood, so...
Then the deal's off.
Fine!
El is one of us now.
She was just trying to keep us safe! She didn't mean to hurt you. It was an accident!
Which is exactly why we need her. She's a weapon! Do you seriously wanna fight the Demogorgon with your wrist rocket? That's like R2-D2 going to fight Darth Vader. We're no use to Will if we're dead.
He should've shaken my hand.
What are you talking about?
Yeah... I mean, I don't know.
That's not true.
He's not my best friend.
I mean, he is, but so are you. And so is Will.
Says who?
Well, I call bull on your logic, because you're my best friend, too.
Whoa.
Uh... definitely.
Eleven! Eleven! El!
Hey, stop. Do you hear that?
El! El?
What?
Just keep going! Keep going!
Stay back! Don't come any closer!
Let him go! Let him go!
What do you want?
How I did what?
You mean piss your pants?
Let him go. Let him go!
My turn for what?
What?
All right, just hold on! Hold on!
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!
El, are you okay? El?
Sorry? What are you sorry for?
No. No, El, you're not the monster. You saved me. Do you understand? You saved me.
Shit! Shit! Shit! Shit!
Yeah. Yeah, I copy.
Nothing.
Shit! I don't know yet.
Hold on. Call Will.
I'll pay you back! Bye!
Down! Down! Down!
That's impossible.
No, no, no. No way. You're not getting a date with her.
I'm not prostituting my sister!
Will! Are you okay?
Come on. You're up on Dig Dug. Let's take that top score back, huh?
There's no way that's Mad Max.
And even if they did, you can't get 750,000 points on Dig Dug. It's impossible.
So what?
I don't know.
Awesome? You haven't even spoken a word to her.
I don't know. He's quiet today.
Fine.
Two boxes?
You already took away my Atari.
I didn't steal. I borrowed.
Everyone graffitis the bathroom stall.
El, are you there? El?
It's me. It's Mike. It's day 352, 7:40 p.m. I'm still here. If you're out there, say something. Or give me a sign. I won't even say anything. Just... I wanna know if you're okay.
I'm so stupid.
Hello, is that you?
Yeah, I'm busy.
Up to us to do what exactly? 
Okay, then what? 
I don't know. 
What are they still doing in there?
Why? 
They're conspiring against me. 
It's not my main concern. It's just a sub-concern. 
It's not over, okay? We're just taking a break. 
[whispers] Conspiring. I told you, they're conspiring.
Not now, Mom! 
Right, yeah, Mrs. Driscoll. What time was this attack?
Right, but what time last night? 
She's flayed, just like Billy. 
Seriously? 
What if they're making something?
Oh, come on, you piece of shit! 
Thanks.
That was what? 
The what? 
Hey.
Does your species like MandM's? 
I like the new look, by the way. It's cool. 
Can you please stop that?
Are you deaf? I thought we were friends, you know? But friends tell each other the truth. And they definitely don't lie to each other. You made me think Will was okay, that he was still out there, but he wasn't. He wasn't! Maybe you thought you were helping, but you weren't. You hurt me. Do you understand? What you did sucks. Lucas was right about you. All along.
Will, is that you? It's Mike! Do you copy? Over.
Will, are you there?
Will!
Was that... Was it...
I, uh... I don't think I can go to school today.
I think I just want to stay home today. I mean, if that's okay?
I think so.
Okay.
Bye.
Lucas, do you copy? Lucas, come on, I know you're there! This is urgent. I'm serious. I'm not gonna stop until you answer. Lucas. Lucas! Lucas, Lucas, Lucas, Lucas, Lucas... Lucas, Lucas, Lucas, Lucas, Lucas, Lucas, Lucas-
No, not "out." I'm not messing around, okay? This is about Will. Over.
No, not his funeral. Screw his funeral!
Just get over here stat. And bring Dustin. Over and out.
We keep losing the signal, but you heard it, right? 
What? 
Lucas, you don't understand. He spoke last night.  Words! He was singing that weird song he loves. Even El heard him! 
I don't think it's about that. I think, somehow, she's channeling him. 
Yeah. 
It's not his ghost. 
I just do! 
I don't know! All I know is Will is alive. Will is alive! He's out there somewhere. All we have to do is find him. 
This isn't gonna work. We need to get El to a stronger radio.
Yeah.
Pretty. Good. You look pretty good.
Okay, remember, if anyone sees us, look sad.
It's locked.
We know. We're just, you know... 
We need some alone time.
Eleanor! She's my, uh-
She's here for Will's funeral.
I have a lot of Swedish family.
Look at these fakers.
Hey! Hey! Hey, Troy! Hey, Troy! You... you think this is funny?
I saw you guys laughing over there. And I think that's a real messed up thing to do.
Come on.
She'll find him. Right, El?
She's doing it. She's finding him!
Will!
I don't know!
El, are you okay?
Can you move? Here, help her up.
This way!
Maybe we can call you "El." Short for Eleven.
No, El, you're not the monster. You saved me, you understand? You saved me.
I need to get through! I need to get through!
I need to warn them. It's a trap! I need to get through. It's a trap. I need to tell them it's a trap.
It's a trap! It's a trap!
We're too late.
We're too late!
We're under attack.
We need to make Will sleep.
He's a spy. If he knows where we are, so does the shadow monster.
He killed those soldiers. He'll kill us, too!
It's a computer programming language.
He made it.
[holding Will] What happened?
"We'll see"? We can't just sit here while those things are loose!
Did you guys know that Bob was the original founder of Hawkins AV?
He petitioned the school to start it and everything. Then he had a fund-raiser for equipment. Mr. Clarke learned everything from him. Pretty awesome, right?
We can't let him die in vain.
His army.
His army. Maybe if we stop him, we can stop his army, too.
It got Will that day on the field. The doctor said it was like a virus, it infected him.
To the tunnels, monsters, the Upside Down, everything.
Okay, so, the shadow monster's inside everything. And if the vines feel something like pain, then so does Will.
Yeah. Like what Mr. Clarke taught us. The hive mind.
And this is the thing that controls everything. It's the brain.
We kill everything it controls.
Even if they come, how are they gonna stop this? You can't just shoot this with guns.
We know it's already killed everybody in that lab.
No. But he does. If anyone knows how to destroy this thing, it's Will. He's connected to it. He'll know its weakness.
Yeah, but he can't spy if he doesn't know where he is.
What?
Well, he shouldn't have. And just because you know the truth, it doesn't mean you're in our party. You do know that, right?
Yeah, she was. Until that thing took her. Just like it took Bob.
Do you remember the first day that we met? It was... It was the first day of kindergarten. I knew nobody. I had no friends and... [sniffling] I just felt so alone and so scared, but... I saw you on the swings and you were alone, too. You were just swinging by yourself. And I just walked up to you and... I asked. I asked if you wanted to be my friend. And you said yes. You said yes. It was the best thing I've ever done.
And then the party escaped into the sewers, and there were those big insect things, and you guys were still on level one.
Then you cast Fog Cloud and you saved us. You saved the whole party.
