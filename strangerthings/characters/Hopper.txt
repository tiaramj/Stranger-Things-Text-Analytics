Hey! Let's talk. Alone.
That's okay, kid. That's okay. 
Oh, jeez- 
Okay. All right! Stop it. 
[sighs] I'm sorry, what? 
How is this important right now? 
You're not hearing me. 
What? 
El... Come on, let's go. It's time.
So, what, we're just not gonna talk about it, huh? 
Okay. How'd you get there? 
A truck?
A big truck? Whose truck was it? 
A man's? 
Sarah? Sarah's my girl. She's my little girl. 
[chuckling] Yeah. Stupid. 
Just really stupid. 
Okay. Sure. Bitchin'. 
Stay here.
Shit..
1...2...3
Yeah, I copy. 
How's the leg? 
No. I'm, uh... on a diet.
I thought- 
How long is a while? [sniffles] 
Yeah. How risky would that be? 
Hey. 
Thought I might find you out here. 
How are you holding up? 
What's he saying?
Two-man rule.
Yeah, two men, two keys, like a... nuclear launch.
Planck's what?
Joyce, did you hear the part where he said the place was like an impenetrable fortress?
Yeah, there is. Our military.
Well, we don't know that anymore because you yelled at them like it was a parent-teacher conference, and then you hung up on them, so we don't know what the hell's going on, because now we're- Wait, wait, what are we do- Oh! Wait, that's right! We're on our way to rescue our children from the big, bad Fourth of July celebration!
What are you gonna do? You gonna walk back to Hawkins?
Whoa!
[yells] Stay here, go over the plans with Smirnoff.
No, you'll scare the children.
Stay put, Freud! You hear me? Stay put!
No, Murray. He's a sick individual who likes to get under people's skin. So, let's not let him, you know, get under our skin.
I just, you seem a little more quiet than usual.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
No, where are they?
Max...
Hold the ride!
[exhales sharply, sees Grigori approaching] We gotta go. We gotta go.
Let's go.
Find Murray, get the car, bring it around back.
[running through the Big Top] Hey! Get your kids outta here! Police! Get 'em out of here! Go!
Hey.
Goddamn! Son of a bitch!
Hey!
Hit it. Hit it! Go! Go! 
Alexei?
[passes Murray the radio] Hey, translate.
"Friends don't lie." Isn't that your bullshit saying? Hey, hey! Hey! Don't walk away from me!
Where'd you go on your little field trip, huh? Where? Did you go see Mike?
Yeah, well, that mother and her daughter did and they called the cops. Now, did anyone else see you? Anyone at all? Come on, I need you to think!
You put us in danger. You realize that, right?
Yeah! Nothing happens and you stay safe!
I don't lie! I protect and I feed and I teach! And all I ask of you is that you follow three simple rules. Three rules. And you know what? You can't even do that!
You're grounded. You know what that means? It means no Eggos... And no TV for a week.
All right, knock it off. Let go. [grunts]  Okay. Two weeks. Let go! A month!
You have got to understand that there are consequences to your actions.
Really? I'm like that psychotic son of a bitch? Wow! All right. You wanna go back in the lab? One phone call. I can make that happen.
Yeah, well, I'm not so crazy about you, either. You know why? 'Cause you're a brat. You know what that word means? How about that be your word for the day, huh? Brat. Why don't we look it up? B-R-A-T. Brat.
Hey! What the hell is wrong with you?
Hey! Hey! 
Hey! Hey! Open this door! Open the damn door! You wanna go out in the world? You better grow up! Grow the hell up!
Hey, you reached Jim. I'm probably doing something incredible right now and I can't...
Hey, kid. Listen, um... about last night, I, uh... I want this place cleaned up by the time I get back and then maybe I'll consider fixing the TV. You hear me? 
[grunts softly] Yeah. Yeah, I'm on my way in, and, yes, I do know what time it is.
Hello?
I overslept. What the hell's going on? It's freezing.
So this thing, this shadow thing. You told your mom it likes it like this. It likes it cold?
How do you know that?
Does he talk to you?
And, uh... what else do you know?
Okay.
Can you describe these now-memories?
Oh, it's nothing. It's just scribbles.
What? What?
What?
Does this mean anything to you?
You think it's that storm?
Killing. He said they were killing. Vines. He's drawing vines. 
Oh Jesus.
Uh, yeah. We're here for a tour.
Okay... A quick look around.
Maybe you seen it on TV. We got a local kid that's missing. We have reason to believe he might have snuck in here.
What's your name?
Patrick, I got a panicked mayor, and I got reporters breathing down my neck and I got a very upset mother. Now, I know the kid's not in there, but I gotta check off this box. Patrick, would you do me a favor? Would you speak to your boss and see what you can swing for us? I'd really appreciate it. I'm talking ten minutes, tops.
Well, that was the idea.
Those cameras, you keep the tapes?
If you don't mind me asking, what do you guys do in here?
Who's in charge here?
Ignore him.
This is the night of the 6th and 7th we're seeing here?
Is that it?
The night of the 7th, we had a search party out for Will. You remember anything about that night?
Yeah, a lot of rain that night. You see any rain on that tape?
I don't know. But they're lying.
Hey, Marissa. How you doin'?
What?
Yep. I'm sorry. Uh... Maybe we could go out again next week? Newspapers? You guys got newspapers around here?
Okay, we're looking for anything on the Hawkins National Laboratory.
Yeah. We are. Uh, so, why don't you start with the Times, and we'll check out the Post. 
What don't you know?
Okay, forget about her. Take a look at this. Dr. Martin Brenner.
Brenner. He runs Hawkins Lab. 
No, this isn't hippie crap. This is CIA-sanctioned research.
Come on. Look at that. Hospital gowns. All of 'em. Now, that piece of fabric that the teacher found by the pipe. That sure looked like a hospital gown to me, huh? Am I wrong?
Come on, man. Work with me here. I'm not saying that there's some grand conspiracy. I'm just... I'm saying maybe something happened. Maybe Will was in the wrong place at the wrong time and he saw something that he shouldn't have.
It's a start.
Hopper here. What do you got?
(gets out the car) Oh, Jesus. Oh, God. Please tell me it's not the kid.
Mmm.
(slurring) Oh, hey, morning, Flo. Morning, everybody.
Oh, yeah?
Well, I looked better than your wife when I left her this morning.
Oh, those garden gnomes again. Well, I'll tell you what, I'm gonna get right on that.
(muffled) Mmm. Okay, I'm gonna get on that. Just give me a minute.
Well, Flo, Flo, we've discussed this. Mornings are for coffee and contemplation.
Coffee and contemplation, Flo!
(sighs deeply) And I apologize again.
Look, boy his age, he's probably just playing hookie, okay?
Well, you never know. I mean, my mom thought I was on the debate team, when really I was just screwing Chrissy Carpenter in the back of my dad's Oldsmobile, so...
His clothes? What's wrong with his clothes?
Maybe.
Is he?
When was the last time you heard from Lonnie?
Why don't you give me his number?
Joyce, 99 out of 100 times, kid goes missing, the kid is with a parent or relative.
What?
Joyce.
Joyce, this is Hawkins, okay?
You wanna know the worst thing that's ever happened here in the four years I've been working here? Do you wanna know the worst thing? It was when an owl attacked Eleanor Gillespie's head because it thought that her hair was a nest.
What, a pig?
Okay, okay, okay. One at a time, all right? You. You said he takes what?
Mirkwood?
Have you ever heard of Mirkwood?
Hey, hey, hey! What'd I just say?
 One at a damn time. You.
Yeah, all right, I think I know that--
I said that I know it!
No.
No. After school, you are all to go home. Immediately. That means no biking around looking for your friend, no investigating, no nonsense. This isn't some Lord of the Rings book.
(softly) Do I make myself clear? Do I make myself... clear?
Hey! I got something.
Yeah, he must have crashed.
Not so hurt he couldn't walk away. Bike like this is like a Cadillac to these kids. He would've walked it home.
Yeah. Cal?
No, no, no, no, no... Phil?
Well, he had a key to the house, right?
So... maybe he came home.
I'm not saying that. Has this always been here?
You're not sure?
Hey. Hey, what's up with this guy, huh?
Jesus!
Listen, I want you to call Flo. I want to get a search party together, all right? All the volunteers she can muster. Bring flashlights, too.
What?
I always had a distaste for science.
Yeah, Ms. Ratliff was a piece of work.
Oh, I believe it. Mummies never die, so they tell me. Sara, my daughter... Galaxies, the universe, whatnot... She always understood all that stuff. I always figured there was enough going on down here, I never needed to look elsewhere.
No, she, uh... She lives with her mom in the city. Thanks for coming out, Teach. We really appreciate it.
I'm sorry. Did I stutter? I told you. Everything.
I know you do experiments on kidnapped little kids, whose parents' brains you've turned to mush. And I know you went a little too far this time and you messed up in a big way. I mean, you really messed up, didn't you? Big time. That's why you're trying to cover your tracks. You killed Benny Hammond, you faked Will Byers' death. You made it look like that little girl just ran away. [he pauses as the agents look shocked] See, I told you. I know everything.
Nobody. But I did give all this over to my friend at the Times. He's gonna blow this thing wide open. [chuckles]
No, I didn't. Here's what's gonna happen. You're gonna let me and Joyce Byers go... you're gonna give us anything we need, and we're gonna find her son. And then we're gonna forget that any of this ever happened. 
Yeah. That's right.
[inhales deeply] [exhales] You gotta give me your word. Nobody's ever gonna find out about this. And those other three kids, those boys, you're gonna leave them alone. Then I'll tell you. Tell you where your little science experiment is.
We came to an agreement.
Look, everything that's happened here and everything that's gonna happen, we don't talk about. You want Will back? This place had nothing to do with it. That's the deal. You got it?
What is this?
Put it on.
Hey, you all right?
I need you to relax, okay? I want you to slow down your breathing, take deep breaths. In and out. Deep breath in... and out. In and out. In and out.
It’s troll's favorite food! [playfully growling he picks up his daughter Sara] Princess!
Roasted princess with paprika and gravy!
Whoa, hey! Hey.
You all right?
Whoa. 
I don't know. I don't know. [he puts down Sarah carefully] Hey, you all right? Whoa, whoa, whoa. Relax, relax. Honey, honey.
Honey, just breathe. Breathe, breathe, breathe. In and out. Slow, slow, slow. [inhaling deeply] In and out with me. In...
You okay?
[reading to Sarah] "I asked Mrs. Spencer what made them red and she said she didn't know and for pity's sake not to ask her any more questions. She said I must have asked her a thousand already. I suppose I had, too, but how are you gonna find things out if you don't ask questions? And what does make roads red? 'Well, I don't know,' said Matthew. It just makes me feel glad to be alive... it's such an interesting world."
[sobbing in a stairwell]
Will!
Come on. 
It was hurt. [sees the monster blood on the floor]
Joyce, come on.
There's more blood. Oh, my God. 
...and lift his chin. 
One second... then pause. Then one second. 
[continues for a few moments] Now! Go! 
Come on... Come on, kid. Come on, kid! 
Come on, kid! 
Mmm. 
Hey, you reached Jim. I'm probably doing something incredible right now, and I can't-
Ugh!
Ugh! 
Shit!
Does anybody copy? Look, if anybody copies, this is Jim Hopper, Hawkins' Chief...
Son of a bitch!
Wait. Wait. No, no! No! No!
Knife.
Hands! Hands!
Cut it...
Bastard!
Joyce.
Hey, Bob.
Wait. [grabs his hat]
Hey. Is everything okay?
Hey. What's going on?
Emotions have been shared. Boundaries have been set. Order... has been... restored.
Uh, this is the first day in six long, excruciating months that they will not be seeing each other. Yes, I think it worked! Yes! 
[laughs] No, stop. It's all you. I'm a puppet, you're the master.
[laughs] Yeah, yeah. I mean, I had to improvise a little bit, you know? It turns out, getting to Mike, now that was the key.
I'll tell you everything over dinner. I was thinking, you know, Enzo's, tonight, 7:00. Hey, before you say no, I'd- I'd like to make one thing crystal clear. This is not a date.
I know, I didn't say anything about a date. I just wanted to clear it up in case there was any confusion on your part.
Great. It's just two friends getting together for a nice dinner. I mean, we've earned it, haven't we?
You'll be home by 9:00.
8:30, I'll pick you up.
7:00. Enzo's. Meeting there. Deal.
Yeah, I'm a little busy right now.
 [sighs and puts his radio away] [chuckles] Duty calls. [clears throat] Oh! Jeez. [trips over and knocks something over as he leaves] Cleanup on aisle five.
See you tonight.
Great. Thank you.
I'm not doing it, Larry.
You don't like your fan club, you want me to shut 'em down. Sound about right?
[laughs] When'd you get so serious?
[clears throat dramatically] [grunts as he sits down]
They're not actually fans?
Mm-hmm?
Well, Larry, I think that they're just exercising their good old fashioned American right to protest. [grunts]
Yeah.
Not that I'm aware of.
Larry, I'm not a politics guy, but I think if you force those people out of here without provocation, I don't think that's a good look for your re-election campaign.
Independence Day?
You can protest all you want, Henry, you've just gotta go through the proper channels first.
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
Ooh, yeah. [laughs and takes a shirt out of the bag]
[chuckles] Yeah. Yeah!
It's cutting-edge stuff, all right? It's cutting-edge!
I'll start off with a Scotch, you can make that a double.
And I think we'll have a bottle of red, as well.
And how's your "chee-anti"?
Chianti.
Great. Women love cherries, huh? All right, we'll have that and two- two glasses, please, one for, uh, me and one for the lady.
[slurring] You know what, Enzo?
I just lost my appetite, all right? So, here you go. You can keep the change.
[blows raspberry] I can do anything I want. I'm the chief of police.
Never better. 
The hell is that? [sniffles] 
Oh, my God. 
Why aren't you burning it? 
Wait. That's where I was. 
It's that damn graveyard. 
I know. I came as soon as I could.
A little bit of trust here, all right? We've been searching all night. Went all the way to Cartersville.
Nothing.
Flo says you got a phone call?
Storm barbecued this pretty good.
What else?
No, it's weird.
No, it doesn't work like that. Now, uh, you're sure it was Will? Because Flo said you just heard some breathing.
It was probably just a prank call. It was somebody trying to scare you.
Well, this thing's been on TV. It brings out all the crazies, you know. False leads, prank calls, uh...
Joyce.
I'm not saying that you're making it up. All I'm saying it it's an emotional time for you.
You hear from, uh, Lonnie yet?
It's been long enough. I'm having him checked out.
I'm sorry?
Yeah? Well, cops are good at finding. Okay? Stay here with your mom. She needs you.
Hey! Anything?
No, nothing but a dead phone.
Kid's missing, man. Show a little class. All right. Come on, let's go! We got a lot of ground to cover.
Whoa, whoa. Careful, careful. I need you alive for the next few days, at least.
George is a liar. You make that jump from this height, that water turns into cement. Hits you like a ton of bricks. Break every damn bone in your body.
Yeah, Flo, talk to me.
Mmm-hmm.
Well, I mostly dealt with strangers back then. Benny was my friend.
You, uh, notice anything... odd about him the last few weeks?
He got any enemies you might know about? I mean, people who might not want him around?
When was the last time you saw him?
Just you and the boys?
Kid? What are you talking about?
This kid... what'd he look like?
He look like this?
Yeah, well, let's... You know, let's forget about the haircut. I mean, if this kid had a buzz cut... could it be Lonnie's kid? 
Tell you what, when we find him, we'll ask.
You got something?
Hey, what do you got?
I don't know... a scared enough one might. His brother said he was good at hiding.
You ever feel cursed? You know, the last person to go missing here was in, uh... the summer of '23. The last suicide was the fall of '61. 
Just give me a minute out here.
[who somehow drove home drunk WHICH YOU SHOULD NOT DO] Hey! Hey! When I say three inches, three-
Oh, hey. I'm sorry. I thought that, uh-
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Your parents know about it?
[slurring] Uh, yeah, it's cool. Yeah. That's- That's really cool.
No, no. Uh, I'll leave. I'll just let you... I'll leave you... 
Oh, God. [groans and grabs some pills to cure his hangover] [grunts] [slurps up some milk and burps] [grunts when he sees Eleven's note 'Gone to Max's sleeping over - El']
Oh! Look who it is!
Yeah, we do. I haven't been stood up like that since Alice Gilbert in the 9th grade. What are you doing? Joyce. Hello?
Okay, you're freaking me out. [he puts on a shirt, even though he hasn't dried off... he may still be drunk]
Yeah. 
Oh, did it?
Wow.
Uh-huh?
Scott. Who's Scott?
Your child's science teacher?
He's pretty brilliant, actually. And I asked him, "How is this happening?" And he built this magnetic field using an AC transformer and plugging it into a solenoid. And- And with that solenoid, which basically-
Slow down, slow down. I just want to get this exactly right, okay? You stand me up...
...no phone call, no apology, because you had to go to Scott Clarke's house.
[scoffs] [chuckles] You've outdone yourself, Joyce. You really have. No, you've outdone yourself.
I don't care what Scott thinks!
He's brilliant, isn't he? He's really brilliant. Is he single too?
Joyce.
Joyce, stop.
It is impossible.
Prove it?
To the lab.
Because some magnets fell off your fridge.
Okay, makes sense.
It makes sense. I'm sorry. I'm a little busy right now, but maybe we can meet up there, like tonight, like seven o'clock? You know, of course, unless something comes up which, you know, it will.
No, I don't think it's a joke. I think that when I asked you out, I think you got scared. I think you got scared, and now, you're inventing things. You're inventing things to get worked up about so that you can push me away. Because God forbid any of us move on! Because that... that would be... [chuckles] I mean, that would be too much, right, Joyce? You know? That would be too much, wouldn't it, Joyce? Wouldn't it, Joyce?
Joyce? Joyce! 
What the hell are you doing?
[putting on shoes] No, you're not going back there. Joyce... Joyce, you're not going back there...
[hopping along, putting his shoe on] Son of a bitch!
Hello? Anybody home? We come in peace.
Let's go!
Joyce. You okay?
You want to wait in the car?
Nobody's home. All the cavities have been filled. I watched 'em do it, Joyce.
It's over. It's over.
You're not losing your mind. Not any more than I am. You know, the other day, I almost shot Betsy Payne's dog because it came rushing at me from behind this fence, and I... I swear to God, I thought it was one of those things. You know that I'm keeping a close eye on things, right?
Because it's important to me. It is important to me that you feel safe. That you and your family feel safe. I want you to feel like this can still be your home. What? You didn't think I'd find out about that? Gary called me. e said he's fixing up your house to put on the market. [sighs] The kids know yet?
After Sarah... I had to get away. I had to get the hell out of that place, you know? Outrun those, uh... those memories, I guess. [exhales] I mean, why do you think I ended up back in this shithole?
But you have something that I never had. You have people that know what you've been through. You have people that care about you. Right here. In Hawkins.
[exhales sharply] Mm. [chuckles]
Wait here.
This is Hawkins Chief of Police! Come out with your hands up! You hear me? Hands up!
What?
"Soon" is when... it's not dangerous anymore.
I don't know.
I don't know.
I don't know.
No!
I said I-
Oh! Shit! Shit!
All right. Where else?
That was it, or you get tired of looking?
They're called flashlights, you dipshits.
All right. [claps] Let's get to work.
This is a joke to you, huh? 
What if there's a leak? 
I don't know, man. You're the scientist. 
Convince me. 
I keep things nice and quiet for you... 
She... She's not around anymore. 
What exactly do you think is going on here-
What do you want me to tell people? 
Yeah. 
Stay where you are. Do not move.
Joyce. [Hopper sighs]
How long have I been out? 
Yeah, but how did I get here? 
Some thug attacked me. 
No, I'm fine. 
I'm fine. I'm fine. 
Where are my clothes? 
[sharp exhale] 
Who? 
Well, I didn't get a good look. 
What is that? 
What are the dashes? 
I think you should stick to sales. 
What do you mean it wasn't a car?
Hey, is he in? 
Great. 
Yeah, I think you might know this guy. 
Really? 'Cause it was just two days ago. 
This was right before I saw you.
What? 
Maintenance. 
You meeting with a lot of plumbers, Larry? 
Not a game, Lar. 
Let's cut the crap, Larry! 
Who is this guy? Government? Military? 
Who is he? 
That is a nice ring you got there, Larry. 
I don't know. Let's find out. 
But you know him. 
What kind of things? 
Who is this guy, Santa Claus? 
The mall? 
Yeah, right. 
Why do they want this land? 
You have records of these purchases, these, uh... 
…these land purchases? 
He just bumped his head. 
Just a little boo-boo, right, Lar? 
Wow, I love the place, Lar. 
Hey, you shoot that fella yourself? 
No shit! 
All right, so... what exactly are we looking at? 
So, what, this is blackmail? 
Protection.
Hey, what is it?
The power plant. 
Your magnets fell. 
Yeah. 
Larry! 
Hey! 
Hey, where do you think you're going, pal? 
No. This place is dead. 
All right, where to next? 
No. [bangs door] [sighs]
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. [turns with his hands up]
Hey... you mind if I borrow this one? [he takes the guards key card and gets through the door, shoots the scanner so no one else can get in behind him]
Will? Will? Will? Will? 
Will? [he searches frantically] Will?
Will?
Will?
Will? Will?
What the hell? [he sees the gate to the upside down and he reaches out to touch it as it pulses] [he hears something behind him and takes out the stolen gun]
Hey! Hey! Hey!
Hey!
What are you doing here?
Yeah, the phone's dead.
Where was this?
No, no. Where did Henry and Dale go hunting?
Mirkwood.
Okay. You go back to the station. I'll take care of this, all right?
Yeah, leave it.
What? 
Yeah. [chuckles] It's funny. [he goes inside quickly - door closes]
Hey..
Yeah..
I know, I know, I know. I just wanted to... I just wanted to hear your voice and, uh... I just wanted to say that, um... even after everything that happened, I don't... I don't regret any of it. And those seven years, they were... everything to me.
No. No.
You know what, actually, I have been drinking, I'm sorry.
Just take care of yourself, okay? Say hi to Bill for me.
[sighs] Oh, Jesus. [sees the Christmas lights and knows he’s going to have a rough time trying to clear the place of a wire]
[panting] Okay. Should be okay, I mean... I can't guarantee it, but it should be okay.
They bugged my place. 
They bugged my place. They put a microphone in the light. [sighs] It's because I'm on to them and they know it. I don't know...
I thought they might be watching you, too. I don't know, the CIA, the NSA, Department of Energy... I don't know.
I went to the morgue last night, Joyce.
It wasn't him.
Will's body, it was a fake.
You were right. This whole time, you were right. 
Let's try this again. Joyce. 
What'd he say? 
I'm sorry?
So what? 
Well, they didn't have cherry. 
You tell him that it all tastes the goddamn same! 
Oh, yeah? You tell him... he can forget it.
Hm. [inhales sharply] Mm.
I'm not gonna hurt him! 
cherry Slurpee!
are the best chance he's got. 
You know, testing us. He's just calling my bluff. 
Joyce, Joyce- 
I'm sorry, what did he say? 
Where the what? 
What is Smirnoff doing? 
Jesus Christ.
Where are you going? 
[gasps]
[panting] [grumbling] 
Whiskey. You have whiskey?
Right? 
But what? 
Yeah, I want 'em to trace me. 
Identification code? 
Oh, no, no, I got it, I got it. [chuckles] I got it.
Now, we, uh... 
we wait. 
As long as it takes.
I am not calm!
You said they were at the festival! 
What are you doing? Joyce? What are you doing? 
What are you doing?
It's been exactly one minute, Joyce. 
Hey!
Hey!
Three-inch minimum! Leave the door open three inches!
El, open this door. Open the-
Hey. You busy?
And then El, she just... slams the door. Right in my face.
I need for them to break up.
No. No. 'Cause talking doesn't work. 
A heart-to-heart? What is that?
Boundaries.
Uh... Maybe you could do it for me?
But?
Okay, sure.
“To share our feelings.”
Hey.
Can I talk to you guys a minute?
Hi.
No. No, nobody's in trouble, okay? I just, um... Uh...
You know what? Your mom called.
Yeah. She needs you home right away.
No, I don't think so. It's your grandma.
No.
No.
No.
Nothing! There's nothing wrong with Nana!
Crazy?
You want to see real crazy? You disrespect me again.
Okay?
Nod if you understand!
You heard her. Take 'em off.
Why don't you ask your son? We found it in his car.
Is that really the question you should be asking right now? I wanna see you in my office.
Why don't you give me a try?
You say blood draws this thing?
Stay here.
What the hell is going on here?
I don't have time for this.
Will you please take a statement... (mouthing) and get her out?
What'd you just say?
No, her hair. What'd you say about her hair?
And what?
What kind of things?
What? Was she alone?
"Losers" What losers?
No, you can't. My mom... my dad are there.
They're gonna be okay. Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.
Hey! Listen to me. Listen to me. The last thing in the world we need is them knowing you're mixed up in all this. 
They haven't found him. Not yet, at least.
Come on, get in the car. Look, we need to find them before they do. Do you have any idea where he might have gone?
I need you to think.
What?
Listen, kid, this is the chief. If you're there, pick up. We know you're in trouble and we know about the girl.
We can protect you, we can help you, but you gotta pick up. Are you there? Do you copy? Over. 
Anybody got any other ideas?
All right, let's go. Let's go!
Is this gate underground?
Near a large water tank?
How much is "lots"?
Worst case, no school.
We're not gonna do anything. I don't want you anywhere near this, all right? Your mom's been through enough already.
Listen to me. I'm gonna find him. All right? You gotta trust me on this. I am going to find him.
So this fort. Where is it?
Hey, get back inside.
Look, if something happens to me, I don't make it back-
Are you kidding me?
Joyce!
Joyce, come on!
Worked for me before, didn't it? 
Come on, trust me.
It's all right. Let me do the talking.
Oh, Jesus
Yeah, I see that.
Sure is. But right now, it's breakfast, okay? Come on, let's eat.
Who wouldn’t see you?
What are you talking about?
You want to go trick-or-treating? You know the rules.
Yeah, so you know the answer.
No. Hey. I don't care. 
I don't care, all right? You go out there, ghost or not, it's a risk. We don't take risks. All right? They're stupid, and...
Exactly. Now, you take that off, sit down and eat. Your food's getting cold. [sighs] All right, look... How about I get off early tonight, and I buy us a bunch of candy, and we can sit around and get fat, and we watch a scary movie together? How's that for a compromise?
C-O-M-promise. Compromise. How about that's your word for the day? Yeah? It's something that's kinda in-between. It's like halfway happy.
5:15. Yeah, sure.
Yes. I promise.
[inhales deeply] He's a kid, Joyce.
Yeah, because they're not nightmares, they're flashbacks. I know a couple guys who have had these things, and it feels like you're there, like it's happening.
Owens said it would get worse. 
What do you wanna do? You wanna take him back to Chicago?
They're all a bunch of quacks. They'll all tell you the same thing, just cost you more money. I think he's right... about trauma. And we're coming up on a year, you know. I think everybody's on edge. Me, you... Will most of all. I think we just gotta get through the next few weeks. [sighs] Nothing's gonna go back to the way that it was. Not really. But it'll get better. In time. [sighs heavily]
Here.
Brings me back to old times.
[sighs] Sharing my cigarettes between...
I know.
So, you're telling me that Merrill poisoned your farm, because he thinks you poisoned his, which, of course, you didn't?
Did you actually see Merrill?
Listen, Merrill threatening to do something and him actually doing something are two very different things.
Cold weather.
Yeah, it's a cold one.
Yeah.
Because you're old?
None of us?
What are you talking about?
Give me those names again.
How far does it go?
Uh...
How's it looking over there?
Uh, yeah, little bit.
Listen. I want you guys to track the rot, see how far it goes. Just, uh, mark anything that's dead.
So take it. And, look, we don't know what caused this. Could be poison. So don't touch anything without gloves. 
You got any marking flags?
Yeah, you got me, kid.
Happy Halloween. [realises the time] Oh, shit, shit, shit, shit, shit, shit, shit. [groans and drives off] [turns back and looks at the grandkid] Hey, kid. Give me some of that candy, would you?
All right. How about now?
Hey, kid. Open up, all right? Look, I know I'm late. I got candy here, all right? I got all the good stuff. Please, will you open the door? I'm gonna freeze to death out here. [breathing heavily as the door unlocks and he goes inside]
Hey, kid. Open up, would you? I got, uh... stuck somewhere, and I lost track of time. And I'm sorry. El, would you please open the door? El? [sighs] All right.  I'm just gonna be out here by myself, eating all this candy. I'm gonna get fat. It's very unhealthy to leave me out here. Could have a heart attack or something. But, you know, you do what you want.
Food court? You sure they said food court?
How big is this thing?
Okay, where's the gate?
You can show us the way?
No. Nope.
Hey, heads up. [throws a radio to Dustin] You can navigate, just from someplace safe.
I know it will, kid. I know.
Better than any of us. But right now, I need you safe. This thing is after you. It's not after me. Do you understand? Hey... I need you to understand. 
[quietly] Okay?
Mike? Be careful. [sighs]
It's a two-man operation. Two!
Change of plans?
Oh, yeah, says who?
And that'll set off the alarm-
Uh...
I didn't say it was a bad plan.
I did not make a noise.
What is up with you and noises?
[realises he's out of bullets] Oh, shit.
Yeah, sure you did.
Yeah, I mean, we should probably invite him over after all this is done. 
Get a six-pack, share some laughs. You know, have a drink.
[sighs] Good luck.
It's taking too long.
No, it's not. It is not.  She could've died back there. She almost did.
Hey. This isn't the way this is supposed to work, all right? You're supposed to say, "Yes, I told you so. That's why we needed to go back to the kids."
You know... I think, despite everything, I mean, despite the arguing, I think we make a pretty good team.
Yeah. We did. We did.
It's kinda hard to serve in a town where you don't live, Detective.
You're still moving outta here. I mean, that is the plan, right?
"How it goes"? How what goes?
Yeah. I mean... yes. [sits down] Absolutely.
Uh, El likes to watch Miami Vice on Fridays. It- It starts at 10:00, so I- I can't be out late on a Friday.
7:00? Enzo's, Friday, I meet you there?
Picking you up, 7:00 p.m. Friday.
[inhales sharply] Just for clarification, just because I... I mean, just... If... When you say "date," just so that we're crystal clear, so there's no confusion- Yeah?
Yeah, okay. Yeah. Okay.
What kind of problem?
Come on, how much longer?
Let's go.
All right.
Give me the code.
[gasps] Uh... again?
Murray? Your goddamn code... is wrong.
Yeah, I'm sure.
How could it be wrong?
[stupidly talking in English] Hey! Everybody out. Everybody out!
Hey. You ready to end this?
Murray, you all set down there?
Will do. Hang tight.
On three.
One...
[grabs Grigori's] I'll see you in hell!
"There's something I've been wanting to talk to you both about. I know this is a difficult conversation, but I care about you both very much. And I know that you care about each other very much. And that's why it's important that we set these boundaries moving forward, so we can build an environment... where we all feel... comfortable... trusted... and open... to sharing our feelings." Feelings.
[murmurs] Feelings. Jesus. [chuckles]
Don't let me stop you. Make mistakes, learn from 'em, and when life hurts you, because it will, remember the hurt.
But, please, if you don't mind, for the sake of your poor old dad...
I told you everything that I saw.
Upstairs or downstairs?
There was a laboratory. It was where they must do experiments or something, and then there was... (inhales deeply) There was this kid's room. 
More like a prison.
Because, I told you, the size of the bed, there was a drawing, there was a stuffed animal-
Yeah, there was a drawing of a... an adult and a child. It said "Eleven" on it.
It was a kid's drawing, Joyce. It was stick figures.
Earl... The night that Benny died, Earl said he saw some kid with a shaved head with Benny Now, I pressed him, he said it might be Will, but maybe... 
Look... this woman, Terry Ives, she claims to have lost her daughter, Jane. She sued Brenner, she sued the government... Now, the claims came to nothing, but what if... I mean, what if this whole time I've been... I've been looking for Will... I've been chasing after some other kid?
Uh, yeah, it's Ives. Terry Ives. That's with a "Y." Yeah, I got a pen. Hang on. Mmm-hmm. Mmm-hmm. Great, thanks. I really appreciate this, Frank. Say hi to the boys for me, too, would you?
I got it.
Hi, we're looking for Terry Ives. Does she live here?
The Hawkins chief of police.
Well, if your sister's Terry Ives, then, yeah, we do.
What was your relationship with Dr. Brenner? You guys keep in touch? 
What's wrong with her?
MK Ultra?
This was the CIA that ran this?
Yeah, but that could've been covered up. Right?
Well, thank you for your time. We appreciate it.
Thank you.
Hey...
We're gonna find him.
We're close.
And then she shows up at Benny's five nights ago, which means we've got a chance. You know what I would give? For a chance? You know what I would give?
Yeah, go ahead.
Cal, I don't have time for this.
Get away from me.
Get away from me.
Yeah, I want a date with Bo Derek. We all want things.
Morning.
Russian spies!
A child? What are you talking about?
A prank.
You got five minutes. Not a second more.
I heard that story. Did you hear the one about the fat man with the beard who climbs down chimneys?
Oh, wow. That's a surprise.
Enlighten me.
Wait. You're telling me Barbara Holland was kidnapped by Russian spies.
Killed?
No.
Do you have any proof of this girl? I mean, has anybody seen her recently?
Excuse me. Sorry. (picks up the phone) Okay. Hello?
I'm sorry. I really hate to do this, but I gotta run. It's an emergency.
Yeah, listen, you know what? I liked your alien theory a lot better. And you want my advice? Why don't you stop bleeding those people dry and go home? All right?
Listen to me. Go home.
You're saying this was fine yesterday?
What about him?
Why's that?
Uh-huh.
Hell of a coincidence.
You got somebody working on that field?
Yeah, screw you, too.
Hey buddy.
So what does this mean for the kid? He's gonna have more episodes, nightmares? 
Yeah, I know. But, you know, university gives out a degree, this guy's got it. And look, that post-traumatic stuff he's talking about, that stuff is real. He's gonna be okay. All right? How's Bob the Brain?
Sorry. Old habit.
Good. I'm happy for you. Really. Hey... Things get worse, you call me first. You call me.
Hey, what'd we talk about?
What?
Yeah, I lost track of time. I'll signal next time, all right? Uh, and it's 8:15. It's not 8-1-5. 
Now, what did we talk about? Dinner first, then dessert. Always. That's a rule. Yeah?
Looks like somebody's home. 
Where's that coming from? 
Hey, dipshits!
Hawkins PD. Hands in the air. 
Don't make me say it again! 
English. You speak English? 
I can't understand you! 
I can't understand you. 
No understand! 
Why's that? 
Oh, yeah? 
Oh, shit. 
Go!
Move, Joyce! 
Come on, Smirnoff. You're coming with us! 
Go, go, go! 
Let's go! Let's go! Move it, Smirnoff! Move it! Run! 
Joyce! Drive!
Come on, Joyce! Quit screwin' around! 
Go! Joyce, drive.
Joyce, please, drive! Drive! 
Get us outta here!
Oh, God! 
Son of a bitch. Son of a bitch! 
Progress. 
Keep it in park, please. 
[sighs] 
Try it again.
Shit. 
Shut up, Smirnoff!
Aw, come on! D'you hear me? I said shut your damn- 
Oh, Jesus.
Whoa! 
Yeah, yeah.
You know what? I'm all ears, Joyce. I'm all ears. I'm all ears! 
Gah! 
Ugh! Gah! [sighs] Damn it.
Oh, right, yeah. Your new boyfriend, right? 
Yeah, he reminds me a bit of a Russian Scott Clarke.
What? 
You son of a bitch!
Hey! Smirnoff! Get back here! 
Hey! C'mere! [grunting] Hey, c'mere! 
I'm a cop.
I'm undercover. 
Just keep your mouth shut, all right? 
All right, all right, hop in. Come on, get in. 
I need to commandeer your vehicle. 
What is your name, sir? 
Todd? 
Todd. 
He's, uh... murdered many children. 
Yeah. Uh, child murderer. 
We should really get going.
You just call the station. 
Ooh, I like the sound of that, Todd! 
You're doing the right thing! 
Come on, let's go. Move it. 
Yeah, he, uh... he was. 
Jim Hopper, Joyce Byers, Smirnoff. 
Alexei. 
I don't know. 
Yeah, I know. I told- I don't know, okay? 
Open the damn door! 
How long is this gonna take, because I- 
No.
No.
Yeah, what? 
What? 
What do you mean? 
Glass houses, Joyce. 
You know, pot calling the kettle black. 
What? 
Oh, oh, this? 
Not a lovers' quarrel, pal.
(distorted) A trooper found something in the, uh... water that's at the quarry. Our working theory right now is that Will... crashed his bike, he... made his way over the quarry and, uh... accidentally fell in. The earth must have given way. Joyce? (speaking clearly) Joyce? Do you understand what I'm saying?
Joyce.
Talking?
The thing that came out of the wall? The thing that chased you?
What exactly was this thing? It was some kind of animal, you said?
It didn't have a face? Joyce.
Joyce, listen to me. Listen to me. After Sarah... I saw her, too. And I heard her. I didn't know what was real. And then I figured out that it was in my mind. And I had to pack all that away. Otherwise, I was gonna fall down a hole... that I couldn't get out of.
I'm just saying that you-
I'm not saying that you're crazy.
Please. (whispers) Please. Listen... I think you should go to the morgue tomorrow and see him for yourself. It'll give you the answers that you need. -But tonight...
I want you to try to get some sleep, if you can.
What's taking so long?
Without Gary? Where's Gary?
So who did the autopsy?
How's your mom doing?
How long's this stuff been going on? With the lights and, uh... Will and the thing in the wall?
Yeah, she is. Hey. She is.
Joyce, wait a second.
So, Gary, tell me about these troopers that brought in Will.
They're all Staties?
They told you that they were gonna take care of the autopsy, huh?
Considering what?
Thanks for stopping by, Gary.
Another, please. And another for my, uh, friend here.
Yeah, that's all right. I'm, uh... I'm celebrating. My daughter, she won the spelling bee today. 
Yeah, that's right. "Odontalgia." That was the word. You know what it means? It's a fancy name for a toothache. Yeah, she's smart. She's real smart. Don't know where she gets it from. I've been tryin' to figure that out for years.
What?
Sarah. Her name's Sarah.
I recognize you. Are you famous or somethin'?
So, you on that case or what?
So that quarry, that's, uh... that's state-run, where they found the boy, huh?
(chuckling) Yeah, well, that's funny. 'Cause, you know, I know for a fact that it's run by the Sattler Company. Frank Sattler? Decent guy, still got a couple operational quarries up in Roane.
Yeah. That's right. So why are you lying to me, man?
I don't have a problem. I'm just a concerned citizen.
Okay... Let's try this one more time. Who told you to be out there? What were you doing out there?
Get close to what?
Who do you work for? The NSA? Hawkins Lab?
Who is that?
Hey, Patty!
Oh, you know, I forgot my hat. I'll just be a minute.
Hey, I love that book. It's a nasty mutt.
Yeah, I just got off the line with O'Bannon. He said that he needs to see you at the station. It's some emergency...
Did I say O'Bannon? I meant...(smacks lips) Okay.
It's me. I know that I've been gone too long, and, uh... I just want you to know that it's not because of you. And it's not because of our fight. Something came up, and, uh, I'll explain everything soon. I just, um... I want you to know that I'm not- I'm not mad at you. I... I'm just sorry.
It's something that's kind of in between. Like halfway happy. Once we fix it up, it's gonna be nice. Real nice. This is your new home.
[echoing] That's where I was. It's a damn graveyard.
Whoa! Whoa!
You sure about that glass?
We gotta go. We gotta go.
Come on!
What do you mean?
Where are the breakers?
To reset the breakers.
Then we get out of here.
Fine, how do I do that?
I don't know what that means.
Teach it to me.
Okay, grab his walkie.
[picks up the gun]All right, you know how to use one of these?
Safety on. Safety off. Point. Squeeze.
If anything happens down there, I want you to come right back up. 
I'm gonna get them out.
I promise.
Son of a bitch did it.
What's wrong?
What?
What are you doing?
Let's go!
Go!
He's gone! He's gone!
Let's go.
Sam Owens. Dr. Sam Owens.
I don't know how many people are there! I don't know how many people are left alive!
I am the police! Chief Jim Hopper!
Yes, the number that I gave you, yes. 
6767... I will be here.
We'll see.
What the hell is that?
Oh, my God, none of this is real. This is a kids' game.
Great. So how do you kill this thing? Shoot it with Fireballs or something?
What the hell are we doing here?
We are!
You don't know that! We don't know anything!
Me, too.
Me, too, Joyce, okay? But how do we do that? We don't exactly know what we're dealing with here.
Yeah, this'll work.
All right, you ready?
You recognize this? Do you recognize this?
Hey.
[sighs] I think he's talking, just not with words.
H-E-R-E. 
Will's still in there. He's talking to us.
It knows. It knows where we are.
Come on. We gotta go.
We gotta go.
Come on, come on. Let's go. Let's go.
Hey. Hey, get away from the windows!
[holds up a rifle] Do you know how to use this?
Can you use this?
