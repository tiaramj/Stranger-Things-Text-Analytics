You should go with him. 
With Jonathan. 
It's okay, Nance. It's okay. 
Is this really necessary? 
Get the door, man. 
Yeah, and then we all die.
No, that's not a point of view, man. That's a fact.
Oh, yeah? That's a no. 
Guys. 
Yeah, it's me. Don't cream your pants. 
I could ask you the same thing. Amigo. 
Huh, that's weird. I don't know her. 
Doesn't ring a bell. Sorry, buddy.
Oh, yeah? Why's that? 
Oh, shit. Listen- 
[groans] 
[groans and falls to the ground] 
Nancy?
[groaning – brings his hand to his head] 
[groans] 
Oh, my God. [having a minor freak out] 
Stop the car! 
[yells] Hello! 
[sighs but takes it]
Holy shit. 
Guys, come on. Keep moving. 
What happened? 
Very funny, man. Nice. Very nice. 
Alright you guys ready? 
[panting] I am in such deep shit. [he flicks his lighter to a flame]
Go, go, go! 
Let's go, let's go! 
Oh, my God! Oh, my God! Oh, my God! Oh, my God! Hey, this way! 
Hold on!
Guys, we gotta go! 
Shut up.
Let's go, let's go!
Let's go! Let's go! 
Come on, come on, come on!
Take his hand!
You don't care. 
Look like a million bucks. 
And you're gonna slay 'em dead. 
Don't do that, okay?
Good luck. 
[slurring] Jesus, slow down!
It's the Indy 300.
It's 300!
[grunts, yells as the vehicle suddenly stops] Oh!
Ow! We're coming!
This sucks.
Surfing! Yeah! Whoa!
I'm a natural! Check it out! Whoop!
You're burning up.
God, no. 
Ow!
Ugh. Boop!
How many times, Dad? I don't do drugs. It's only marijuana.
Boop.
Oh, can we make a pit stop at the food court?
Ooh!
Uh-oh.
The car's off the board.
They took the keys. The Russians, they took the keys. Like, forever ago.
That's a bummer, right?
I taste it! I taste it!
Why are we running?
Whoa!
Dude, these seats blow.
Fine, Dad.
I have no idea.
[drinking water from a water fountain] That's amazing.
Wait, wait, the hot chick was Alex P. Keaton's mom?
But they're the same age.
[snickers] Then why is it called Back to the Future?
Wh... What?
[looks up at the ceiling] [echoing] Wow.
[echoing] Hey, Robin. You gotta check this out.
Check this... This... The ceiling, it's beautiful.
Holy shit. No. You think we puked it all up?
Okay. Interrogate you. Sure. Um... When was the last time you, uh, peed your pants?
What?
[laughs] Oh, my God.
Yeah, it's definitely still in her system.
Okay. Hit me.
Yep. Nancy Wheeler. First semester, senior year. [imitates gunshot, chuckles]
Hm. Turns out, not really.
No.
I think it's because I found someone who's a little bit better for me. [chuckles] It's crazy. Ever since Dustin got home, he's been saying, "You know, you gotta find your Suzie. You gotta find your Suzie."
It's some girl from camp, I guess his girlfriend. To be honest with you, I'm not 100% sure she's even real. But that's not- that's not really the point. That doesn't matter. The point is, this girl, you know, the one that I like, it's somebody that I... didn't even talk to in school. And I don't even know why. Maybe 'cause Tommy H. would've made fun of me or... I wouldn't be... prom king. It's stupid. I mean, Dustin's right, it's all just a bunch of bullshit anyways. Because, when I think about it, I should've been hanging out with this girl the whole time. First of all, she's hilarious. She's so funny. I feel like, this summer, I have laughed harder than I have laughed... in a really long time. And she's smart. Way smarter than me. You know, she can crack, like, top secret Russian codes and... You know? She's honestly unlike anyone I've ever even met before. Robin? [tapping on stall] Robin, did you just OD in there?
Yeah, well, I already got a bunch of blood and puke on my shirt, so... What do you think?
This girl.
She is awesome. And what about the guy?
Really? 'Cause I think he's thinking a lot more clearly than usual.
I really like you.
Robin, that's exactly why I like you.
Yeah.
Mrs. Click?
But Tammy Thompson's a girl.
Yeah? [cogs turn] [softly] Oh.
Holy shit.
No, I just, uh... just thinking.
I mean, yeah. Tammy Thompson, you know, she's cute and all, but... I mean, she's a total dud.
Yes, she is. She wants to be, like, a singer. She wants to move to, like, Nashville and shit.
She can't even hold a tune. She's practically tone-deaf. Have you heard her?
All the time. [singing atonally] ♪ You see me now tonight ♪
♪ You see me... ♪
She sounds exactly- That's a great impersonation of her.
She sounds like a Muppet. She sounds like a Muppet giving birth.
[sings like Kermit] ♪ And if you could hold me tight ♪
Exactly.
Uh, Dustin?
Yeah, we might not wanna go to your house.
Well, I might've told them your full name.
Dude, I was drugged.
So?
Oh, yeah, it's easy for you to say.
Shit.
Come on, let's go, let's go.
True, yeah. Totally true. It's absolutely our fault.
Superpowers. She threw it with her mind. C'mon, catch up.
Yeah, which is how we found out about the Russians in the first place.
The Russians!
[Mom mode engaged] How many times do I have to tell you with the low battery?
It was pretty damn close.
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Jesus! Do you ever stop talking? Come on!
Hey, what's the matter?
Mmm.
Mmm-hmm.
Hey!
Is everything okay?
Oh, I didn't... I didn't tell anyone.
You're being paranoid.
No. No, it's cute Hey... I had a good time.
Mmm. Hmm.
Ugh, I don't care what it is, it's disgusting! Get it off the table. We're eating here. 
Come on, don't be an ass, man. Did you... Did you see her leave last night or not?
*mouthing* Okay, chill.
Listen... I'm sure she's fine. She's probably just... she's probably just, like, skipping or something.
Hey, man.
Nicole here was, uh, telling us about your work.
And we'd just love to take a look. You know, as... connoisseurs of art.
Oh, no? Oh...
Man, he is totally trembling. He must really have something to hide.
(looks in the bag and pulls out the pictures) Ah... Here we go Oh, man.
No. No, this is called stalking. Mmm-hmm.
So... we'll just have to take away his toy.
No, no, wait, wait...Tommy, Tommy.
It's okay. Here you go, man
Come on, let's go. The game's about to start.
Hey, Nance! Come on.
Bull, if you did that, you'd be in detention right now.
Whoa, Nance, where you going?
Well, what do you mean? The game's about to start.
(sighs) What the hell's wrong with her?
Oh, give me a break.
Mmm-hmm?
In a minute.
Wait, wait, wait. Let's... Come on, let's do something tonight, yeah?
Oh, come on. What's your GPA again? 3.999...
Well, then, just let me help.
C-minus.
So I'll be over around, say, like, 8:00?
I'll climb through your window. She won't even know I'm there. I'm stealthy, like a ninja. 
Wait, wait, wait. Just... Okay, forget about that. We can just... We can just, like, chill in my car. We can find a nice quiet place to park, and...
Well, why do you think I want it to be nice and quiet?
I figured we'd just study here.
Oh, come on. I can't have you failing this test. So just... bear with me.
What'd I tell you? Ninja.
Mmm. "In a molecule of CH4, the hydrogen atoms are spatially oriented towards the center of--"
Wow. Jesus, how many of these did you make?
How about this? How about... How about every time that you get something right, I have to take off an item of clothing. But every time you get something wrong--
Oh, come on. Come on.
Come on. It'll be fun.
"During fractional distillation, hydrocarbons are separated according to their--"
Ooh, It's boiling points.
Yeah, that's not what you said.
No? Oh, do you need... Do you need help, or...
What?
That's weird, I... don't see them.
No. Nancy, no.
You mean, you're not a slut.
You know, you're so cute when you lie.
Bad Steve. (groans) Bad. Don't do that to Miss Nancy...
You are beautiful, Nancy Wheeler.
"Compared to the rate of inorganic reactions, the rate of organic reactions is generally..."
Hey. Nancy, what- 
I'm not trying to start anything, okay?
Yeah, what's going on? 
Wait a sec. Did he do this to you? 
Nancy, let me in! 
What is... What the-
Whoa. What is all-
What is that smell? Is that... is that gasoline? 
[stutters] Wait. What? What is going on? 
Okay, is this a joke? Stop. Put the gun down. 
Wait. Is this a... What is this? 
No, no, no! No, no! 
Wait, what's here? 
He's stuck! 
Did you give it to him? 
Listen... I've been thinking... I love you. I'm sorry. I'm sorry? What the hell am I sorry for?
No.
Hey. What the hell? Hey!
Where is she?
Bat? What bat?
Why?
Now?
Henderson. [laughs and goes over to Dustin] Henderson! He's back! He's back!
I got the job! [imitates trumpet] Hey! Oh! 
[groans, laughs] Ah!
[sighs]
No, no. No way. Hotter than Phoebe Cates? No.
[doesn't know how to react] Wow. Yeah, that's great. Proud of you, man. That's ro-- That's kinda romantic. That's like... Wow.
Yeah. I mean, sure. It's not really a good idea for me, though. I gotta keep in shape for the ladies.
Ignore her.
She's not. So, where are the other knuckleheads?
No.
Whoa. Seriously? I swear to God. Mm.
Glory? What glory?
Oh. Mm.
Mm-hmm.
What?
[clearly can't hear him] Just speak louder.
Jeez, shh. Yeah, okay, that's what I thought you said. What- What does that mean?
Huh.
American heroes.
More?
I like more.
What's the catch?
With what?
It sounded familiar.
The music. The music right there at the end.
I'm trying to listen to the Russian, but there's music-
I don't know.
It wasn't me.
Whoa! What do you think you're doing?
[laughs] Oh-ho-ho!
Idiot.
Oh, seriously?
Well, that's thrilling.
Okay, here you go, you got a strawberry and then a vanilla with sprinkles, extra whipped cream.
Wait a second. Are you even allowed to be here?
That... Okay.
"The week is long, the silver cat feeds, when blue meets yellow in the west."
I mean, it just... it just can't be right.
How is this great news? [chuckles] I mean, so much for being American heroes. It's total nonsense.
What do you mean, a code?
That's a total stretch.
You're buying into this?
Uh, it's a quarter. I need- Do you have a quarter?
Quarter!
Shh!
Would you two just shut up and listen?
"Indiana Flyer"? I don't... I don't think so. This code, it... didn't come from Russia. It came from here.
Wait a sec. How big? 
How do you know? 
Yeah! How do you know it's not just a lizard? 
I don't hear shit. 
All right?
Get down here. 
All right, let's go. 
I mean, why would a girl like some nasty slug anyway?
Yeah, exactly. It drives them nuts. 
You just wait until, uh... until you feel it. 
You feel that and then you make your move.
No, whoa, whoa. Slow down, Romeo. 
Yeah. Yeah, she is. 
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Hey, hey, hey. 
You're not falling in love with this girl, are you? 
Okay, good. Don't. [they start walking again]
You do four puffs of the Farrah Fawcett spray. 
Okay. 
I mean, she's hot. 
Who's that? 
That's good. Just show her you don't care. 
No.
There. 
I don't know. 
Maybe he's sick of cow. [he grabs the bat]
A little busy here!
No. No way. They're going somewhere.
(grabs the flashcards) I don't know, I think you've studied enough, Nance.
I'm telling you, you know, you got this. Don't worry. Now, on to more important matters. My dad has left town on a conference and my mom's gone with him, 'cause, you know, she doesn't trust him.
So are you in?
Oh, God, that's depressing.
Shut up.
Hello, ladies.
You're not?
You are a cliché. What with your... your grades and your band practice.
Okay, party girl. Why don't you just, uh, show us how it's done, then?
You gotta make a little hole right in
Yeah...
Oh, it's... It's, uh, down past the kitchen, to the left.
Whoo!
Are you kidding?
Okay, well, you know, you are cleaning the sheets. You all right?
Yeah? Come on, let's get you some dry clothes.
Oh... Yeah, right. Sorry. 
Damn.
Uh, I guess I don't totally know what I'm looking for.
Yeah, exactly. I don't know what an evil Russian looks like.
Mm-hmm?
Right, okay, duffel bags. Oh, you've gotta be kidding me.
Anna Jacobi's talking with that meathead Mark Lewinsky.
Aw, Jesus Christ, whatever happened to standards? I mean, Lewinsky never even came off the bench.
Stop, hey. Stop.
Seriously, if you say Robin again-
No, don't. No.
Stop, no, no, no.
No.
No! No, man, she's not my type. She's not even... in the ballpark of what my type is, all right?
Thank you.
For your information, she's still in school. And she's weird. She's a weirdo. And she's hyper. I don't like that she's hyper. And she did drama. That's a bad look. 
No.
Oh, primitive constructs? That some stupid shit you learned at Camp... Know... Nothing?
Hm.
Oh, Suzie. Yeah, you mean, "hotter than Phoebe Cates."
And, uh, let's think about how exactly did you score that beautiful girlfriend? Oh, yeah. With my advice. Because that's how this works, Henderson. I give you the advice, you follow through. Not the other way around, all right, pea-brain?
Where?
Give me that. [grabs the binoculars] Shit. Duffel bag.
We're losin' him.
You're not gonna believe who Dustin thought was a Russian.
No, I did not.
No, I did not.
Robin. What are you doing?
Cracked what?
What do you think's in there?
Great. That's great.
Let me check it out.
Lemme see it.
What are you doing here? 
I figured Jonathan would take you. 
And then what? 
Well, then tell me. 
You love me. 
All right! 
[passive aggressively] I think that you're bullshit.
Well, you know...
I could just take him out. 
The Russian guard.
Okay, that was one time-
Listen, that doesn't count. 
It was... 
...things that all added up... 
Robin. Hey, Robin! Hey, what- what are you doing? 
Well, half of that's mine. Where're you going? 
Oh, dude. 
Come on, man, not my scooper. 
I mean, I don't really see a way in.
Flashlight. 
Thank you. 
I'm pretty sure it's Gumbo. 
Okay. I'll push ya.
What? 
I'm pushing! 
I'm not playing, I have terrible footing. 
I'm gonna just shove you, ready? 
One, two... 
That work? 
Okay, well, what's the problem? 
Oh, God. 
That's definitely not Chinese food. 
Uh, maybe you guys should, you know, stand back. 
Just... Just step back, okay? 
Step back. Seriously. 
… Okay. 
What the hell? 
Just open the- Press the other button. 
Would you stop? 
Would you let me just do it? Would you stop? 
Oh, shit.
Whoa, whoa, hey, whoa, whoa. 
What are you doing? 
I hope that's not meant for me.
Oh. Well, uh... listen, I'm really sorry. I mean, even before you threatened me with the baseball bat. Okay. I panicked and... [sighs] I mean, I was a total dick.
Totally, but... you know, who cares? Screw 'em…. Any news about Barbara? Parents heard from her? Or...
Hey, listen. Why don't we, uh, why don't we catch a movie tonight, you know? Just kinda pretend everything's normal for a few hours. All The Right Moves is still playing. You know, with your lover boy from Risky Business?
You know, Carol thinks I actually kinda look like him. What do you think? Huh? [he takes the baseball bat and sings into the end of it like a dingus] ♪ Just take those old records Off the shelf ♪ … ♪ I'll sit and listen to them by myself ♪
Yeah, sure. Sure, yeah, yeah.
I should go.
Yeah. Yeah, of course… ♪ Just take those old records Off the shelf ♪ .. ♪ I'll sit and listen to them... ♪ [he trails off as he leaves]
Not exactly. 
It's really bad. 
Shit. 
Shit. Go, go, go, go, go! 
Move! Let's move!
Go! Shit! Shit, shit, shit! 
Go, go, go!
This way! 
Oh, shit! Oh, shit! 
Come on! Go, go, go, go, go!
Shit!
Hold the door! 
Robin! 
Help me, come on! 
Go! Just get out of here! 
No! Just go get some help, okay? 
What are you doing?! 
That one stung. [gasps for air] 
Think I'm a spy in a sailor's uniform? 
[groans] [grunts]
[laughs nervously] 
Oh, come on. No, no! No, seriously-
[slurred] Hey, would you stop yelling?
Is this his place of work? I love the vibe. 
Charming. 
Oh. 
Uh-huh. 
And I could cut the binds. 
Gotcha. Okay, yeah, we can do that. 
Those morons. They left scissors in here? 
Total morons. Okay. 
Okay, good, hop on three. I gotcha. 
Okay.
Right. 
We're close. Ready? 
It's okay, it's okay. Don't cry. Robin. 
Are you laughing? 
Jesus! 
What? 
[sighs] 
Yeah, I know. 
[chuckles] Yep. [laughs] 
You know, I wish I'd known you in Click's class. 
Really, I do.
[winces]
Did you even clean that thing?! 
Honestly, I don't really feel anything. Do you? 
Yeah, I feel- I feel fine. I kinda feel good. 
What? 
Morons. They messed up the drug. 
Morons!
Hey! Whoa-oh! 
Something's wrong. 
[murmurs] 
Scoops. [chuckles] Scoops Ahoy.
Totally by accident. [chuckles] 
What is that shiny little toy?
Whoa, whoa, hey, hey. Wait! No! Wait! Wait! Whoa! 
Uh, well, Dustin knows. 
Yeah, Dustin Henderson, he knows.
Yeah.
Again? Seriously?
Come on, come on. I swear, if anybody hears about this-
That's weird.
Oh, really?
Let there be light.
Ooh, Purdue. Fancy.
Oh, I'm sorry.
I think that's, like, really important.
I... This is... my first day here.
Yeah, yeah, I can count.
Yep, I can read, too.
Screw company policy.
Right? Ooh.
Ahoy, ladies!! Didn't see you there.
Share it in the booth? Anybody? It's hot out there.
Carol, for once in your life, shut your damn mouth!
You're both assholes. That's my problem.
Yeah, I'm serious. You shouldn't have done that.
You know what.
I should've put that spray paint right down your throat.
You know, neither of you ever cared about her. You never even liked her, because she's not miserable like you two. She actually cares about other people.
I told you to watch your mouth!
Get out of my face.
Need a hand?
I just... I wanna help.
Nancy. What's going on? Are you okay?
Doing what?
What are you talking about?
Nance-
I know.
I know. Okay? I get it. But listen, there's nothing we can do about it.
Well, you know that we can't do that.
This isn't some game, Nance. If they found out that we told any... They could put us in jail. Okay? Or worse, they could destroy our families. They could do anything they want. Okay? Just think about what you're saying. Hey... Hey, hey... Hey, it's... [sighs] It's hard, but let's... let's just go to Tina's stupid party... wear our stupid costumes that we've been working on for a stupid amount of time, and just pretend like we're stupid teenagers, okay? Can we just do that, just for tonight?
Come here.
Hey... Whoa, whoa! Hey... Whoa, whoa, whoa! Take it easy. Take it easy. Nance, Nance, Nance...
No, no, no.
No, you've had enough, okay?
Nance, I'm serious. Hey. Hey. Hey. Stop. No, I'm serious. Put it down.
Nance, put it down.
Nance. Nance, I'm sorry. That's not coming off, Nance.
Come on. Let me just take you home, okay? Come here. Let me take you home. Come on.
No, I didn't want this. I told you to stop drinking.
No, it's not bullshit. Okay? No, it's not bullshit, Nancy.
[stammers] What?
"Like we're in love"?
You don't love me?
Robin.
You're not helping.
Okay, so, just to be clear, this... this big fleshy spider thing that hurt El, it's some kind of gigantic... weapon?
But instead of, like, screws and metal, the Mind Flayer made its weapon... with melted people.
Yeah, okay. I- Yeah, I'm just making sure.
Oh, man, now this... this is what I'm talkin' about!
Oh, screw Todd! Steve's her daddy now.
All right, where are we going?
Weather-what?
Okay. Jesus!
Jesus, how far is this place, man?
I'm- I'm- I'm not! I'm not! I think she sounds real. You know, totally, absolutely real.
There's not a road here.
Jesus! Hang on!
Whoa! Henderson, where are we going?!
Whoa!
Oh, Jesus!
Yes, we are. Come on, baby. Come on, baby!
Come on! [grunts] Come on. Come on. Come on!
Hey, guys?
To get them the hell outta there! Stay here, contact the others!
Are you okay?
Go, go, go!
It's turning around.
It's turning around!
Hey, asshole! Over here! [grunts, throwing a firework] 
Dustin! We're out of time!
Yeah. Why not? She's, like, super well-respected.
Wha-
Favorite movies?
Uh... Animal House, for sure.
Um...
Yeah. Uh... Star Wars.
A new what-now?
The one with the teddy bears. Duh. [squeals like an Ewok]
No? Uh... Oh, the one that just came out. The movie that just came out. The one with the DeLorean and Alex P. Keaton, and he's trying to bang his mom. [chuckles] The time... Yeah, those are my top three. Classics.
Why?
Goddammit. This is- Hm.
Oh! Fast Times. Fast Times. Ever heard of it? Top three for me, Keith.
That's... that's not it.
She was acting weird. I mean, something was wrong.
What?
Would you just- Stop.
Would you just shut up?
Shut up!
I'll just be a minute.
What's wrong with me? What's wrong with you? I was worried about you. I can't believe that I was actually worried about you. 
What, you just let him into your room to... study? 
You were just what? Finish that sentence. Finish the sentence. (scoffs) Go to hell, Nancy.
You know what, Byers? I'm actually kind of impressed. I always took you for a queer, but I guess you're just a little screw-up like your father. Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah, that house is full of screw-ups. You know, I guess I shouldn't really be surprised. A bunch of screw-ups in your family.
I mean, your mom... I'm not even surprised what happened to your brother.
I'm sorry I have to be the one to tell you, but the Byers, their family, it's a disgrace to the entire-
Hey. Hey! Get out of here! Get out of here! Get out of here!
It's crap, I know
It's not good. 
Yeah, I guess.
It connects because... because, you know, we both won. Do you think I should start from scratch?
It's tomorrow for early application. Can you come and help me tonight?
Oh, my God!
No, no, no. What's the point?
I'm calm. I'm calm.  I'm just being honest. You know, I mean... I'll end up working for my dad anyway.
I don't know, Nance. Is that such a bad thing? There's insurance and benefits and all that adult stuff. And if I took it, you know, I could be around for your senior year.
Just to look after you a little bit. Make sure you don't forget about this pretty face.
Nance, I'm serious.
I love you.
I missed you.
Tell me about it.
Sorry.
Okay. Ready?
[sighs] Okay.
Right. I love KFC.
No, I don't think so.
That's... That's great. No, that's really... That's great, right?
It's finger-lickin' good.
We're going down! We're going down! 
Come on, press something! Just press the button! 
Oh! 
My groin. It fell on my groin. 
Dustin! [strains] 
Get this off of me! 
I can't move. [grunts]
They're buttons. They have to do something. 
A what? 
What were you saying about climbing? 
So? 
Let's go. 
Go. Go, go, go, go, go.
Henderson. Go, go. 
Jesus Christ.
Let's go, come on. 
What the hell is promethium? 
About the- 
So it's connected? 
How? 
Okay, clear. Clear, come on, let's go. 
Relax. All right? Relax. Nobody saw... 
Shit. 
Jesus! 
Saw what? 
You saw the comms room?
Shh! Move it.
Let's go. 
Sh, sh. Come on. 
Jeez... [laughs softly] [Steve chuckles] 
Let's go. 
So, wait a sec. I don't understand. You went back to my house?
Yeah, okay, but why didn't you just talk to me? That's crazy.
You seriously think you saw a guy in a mask just hanging out in my yard?
But he had no face?
Oh, this is bad. This is really bad.
The cops... they're gonna want to talk to all of us now. Tommy, Carol, everybody who was at the party.
My parents are gonna murder me!
You don't understand. My dad's a grade-A asshole.
Okay, just... When you talk to the cops, just... don't mention the beers. It's just gonna get us both in trouble, and Barbara's got nothing to do with it, okay?
Nancy. 
Nancy, wait! Nancy!
Malted?
Yeah, and he's gonna eat a lot more than just cats.
He ate Mews.
It's Dustin's cat.
Guys?
Guys!
