[Kline grumbles] 
Hotdog vendor: What? 
Kline: Your stand. It's right in the main thoroughfare. 
Hotdog vendor: Where do you want it, sir?
(The poor hotdog vendor moves his cart)
Kline: Sheesh, do I have to do everything myself?
(He has done nothing)
[ominous synth music playing] 
[Kline clears throat] 
(Cut to – inside the “Gravitron”)
Grigori: A call? 
Grigori: We want you to find him. 
Grigori: Backup. 
[Kline grunts]

(Kline nods)
[Kline choking] 
[playful orchestral music playing]
Murray: Never said it was.
(Hopper takes a hefty bite of his cheeseburger)
Hopper: Let's try this again. Joyce. 
Joyce: Alexei…
Joyce: …the generators, what are they powering? 
Alexei: [in Russian] This tastes like shit strawberry. 
Hopper: What'd he say? 
Murray: He says, "It's strawberry."
Hopper: I'm sorry?
Murray: His... Slurpee. 
(Alexei wipes his mouth with the handkerchief)
Murray: He says it's strawberry. 
Hopper: So what? 
Joyce: Hop, he did ask for cherry. I mean...
Hopper: Well, they didn't have cherry. 
Murray: Tell him what? 
Hopper: You tell him that it all tastes the goddamn same! 
Murray: [in English] He respectfully disagrees. 
(Hopper’s chewing slows, he’s ready to kill someone)
Murray: It's not the same at all, and he would like... 
(Alexei watches Woody Woodpecker)
Murray: cherry. 
[Alexei chuckles] 
Hopper: Oh, yeah? You tell him... he can forget it.
Murray: [in Russian] He says forget it. No cherry. 
Alexei: [in Russian] No cherry, no deal. [laughs at the TV] 
(Hopper nods and sits forward, he licks his fingers)
[smacks lips] 
Murray: Yeah. 
Hopper: Hm. [inhales sharply] Mm.
[Hopper yells] 
(Hopper gets up swiftly)
Murray: Oh, shit! 
(Hopper grabs Alexei who lets out a VERY manly scream)
[Hopper yelling] 
Joyce: No, Hop- 
(Murray jumps out of his chair and backs up)
[grunting] 
Murray: Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait! 
Hopper: I'm not gonna hurt him! 
Joyce: What are you doing? 
(Hopper picks Alexei up again)
[Hopper growls]

Hopper: are the best chance he's got. 
Alexei: Ooh! [grunts in pain]
(Back inside)
(Outside - Alexei turns the key and starts the car) 
["Neutron Dance" plays] 
♪ I don't wanna take it anymore ♪
[Alexei laughs giddily] 
(Back inside) 
(Joyce and Murray look concerned at hearing the car start)
Murray: Jim... 
Joyce: Uh... 
Murray: I, uh, believe he has started the car. 
Joyce: Hopper. 
Hopper: You know, testing us. He's just calling my bluff. 
(Outside – Alexei backs the car out of where it’s parked)

(He lines the car up with the gate and starts driving out)
(Back inside)
Murray: I believe he is now driving away.

Alexei: [muttering in Russian]

(Hopper tosses the keys into the air and catches them)
Erica: By "we," you're including Lucas? 
Dustin: Yes, of course.
Erica: So, all that shit you told me, Lucas was there? 
Dustin: Yeah. 
Erica: My brother, Lucas Charles Sinclair? 
Dustin: Yes! 
Erica: I don't believe you. 
Erica: That's correct. 
Dustin: Makes total sense. 
Erica: Um, you need help with that? 
Dustin: No. 
Erica: Well, I mean, it's taking a while, so- 
Dustin: Yeah, no shit, Sherlock.
Dustin: Yeah, with that attitude, they are. Jee-zus! 
Erica: Did you just do all of that in your head? 
Erica: I'm good with numbers. 
Dustin: Holy shit. You're a nerd. 
Erica: Come again?
Dustin: You... are... a... nerd. 
Erica: Okay, you better take that back, nerd. 
Dustin: Can't put the truth back in the box. 
Erica: But it's not the truth. 
Erica: That was a pretty straightforward equation. 
Dustin: Fact number two: you're a political junkie.
Dustin: Fact number three: you love My Little Pony. 
Erica: And what does My Little Pony have to do with this? 
Dustin: Because I'm...
(He removes the panel he’s been unscrewing)
Dustin: a nerd. 
(Dustin pulls the wires out to deactivate the fan)
[electricity crackles] 
[powering down noise] 
Dustin: Let's go... nerd. 
Erica: You... 
(Steve is punched in the face)
[Steve groans] 
Steve: That one stung. [gasps for air] 
Ozerov: Who do you work for? 
(Ozerov looks at the soldier again)
Steve: Think I'm a spy in a sailor's uniform? 
(And Steve takes another punch to the stomach)
Steve: [groans] [grunts]
Ozerov: How did you get in? 
[soldiers laughing] 
Steve: [laughs nervously] 
[soldiers continue laughing] 
Ozerov: [chuckles] 
[laughter stops] 
Ozerov: Who do you work for?
Steve: Oh, come on. No, no! No, seriously-
[soldier grunts] 
[soldiers speaking Russian] 
[Soldiers grunting] 
Robin: Get your hands off me! 
(They throw her to the ground next to Steve)
[yelps, grunts] 
Robin: Hey... Steve? 
[door buzzer sounds] 
(Ozerov enters)
Robin: Steve? Steve? 
(She shakes him)
Robin: Steve? What did you do to him? What did you do? 
(Ozerov straight up backhands Robin)
[Ozerov grunts] 
[Robin groans] 
[Robin whimpers] 
Ozerov: [in Russian] Put them in the chairs. 
[soldier speaks Russian] 
Robin: Don't touch me! Steve-
(They’re placed roughly on the chairs)
(They’re tied up)
[Robin grunts, yelps] 
Robin: What did you do?! [Robin grunts] 
Robin: Don't touch him. 
Ozerov: [clicking tongue – tutting condescendingly)
(He drops Steve’s head)
Robin: Steve? Steve, can you hear me?
(He gets in Robin’s face)
[Ozerov laughs] 
[soldiers laugh] 
(Robin spits in his face)
(Ozerov wipes off Robin’s spit as she stares him down)
[door buzzer sounds]
Robin: Bastards. 
(Ozerov and his little posse leave)
Robin: Let us outta here! Bastards! Let us out! Let us out!
[water splashing gently] 
[ominous synth music playing] 
[static hissing] 
Mike: It can't be good for her to be in there for this long.
Max: Mike, you need to relax. 
Mike: What if she gets brain damage or something? 
Lucas: Oh, shit. Is that, like, a real thing?
Mike: Oh, and you do? 
Max: No, I... 
[indistinct male voice on phone] 
[dial tone sounding] 
[Max and Mike argue indistinctly in background] 
Nancy: [sighs] Who's next? 
Jonathan: There is no next. 
(He crosses out “Blackburn’s Farm Supply)
Nancy: It doesn't make sense. 
Jonathan: What part of any of this makes sense? 
(Max and Mike come over)
Mike: The way that you frame that is such bullshit. 
Nancy: El dumped you? 
Mike: Yeah, because she is conspiring against me. 
(He motions to Max)
Mike: She's corrupting her.
Max: No, enlightening her. 
Mike: She's risking her life for no reason.
(Uh oh now Lucas and Will are getting involved)
Lucas: Killing, flaying... 
Will: Transforming into monsters. 
Nancy: And El's not stupid. 
(Mike rolls his eyes because no one’s agreeing with him)
Nancy: She knows her abilities better than any of us. 
Max: Exactly, thank you. 
Nancy: And she is her own person. 
Max: Exactly. 
Nancy: With her own free will. 
(Mike looks betrayed by Nancy, but girls stick together so)
(Oh snap)
Lucas: Wait, what? 
Mike: Oh, she didn't tell you this? 
Lucas: No. 
Mike: Your girlfriend used El's powers to spy on us. 
Will: Yeah, who cares? 
Lucas: I care. 
Mike: Yeah. I guess girlfriends don't lie, they spy. 
Max: We were just joking around. 
Max: You weren't. 
Mike: But what if I was?
Max: Then gross! 
Nancy: Seriously, Mike? 
(Silence – this is awkward)
[door opening]
(El comes out of her room)
Eleven: What's going on? 
Mike: Nothing. Nothing. 
Lucas: Just a family discussion. 
Eleven: Oh. 
(Awkward pause)
Eleven: I found him. 
Nancy: Found who?
Alexei: [speaking Russian] 
Murray: It requires much strength, power.
Alexei: [speaking Russian] 
Murray: [speaking Russian to Alexei] 
Alexei: [chuckles lightly] [speaking Russian] 
Alexei: [speaking Russian] 
Murray: They had to come to where the... where the, uh... 
Hopper: Where the what? 
Murray: I don't understand what he's saying. 
Joyce: I thought you were fluent. 
(Joyce puts her hands up in defence and backs off)
Hopper: What is Smirnoff doing? 
Murray: He's showing me. 
Alexei: [speaking Russian] 
Alexei: [speaking Russian] 
Alexei: [speaking Russian] 
Alexei: [speaking Russian] 
Murray: But it seems this key was only half the equation. 
Alexei: [speaking Russian] 
Murray: Location- Location was the other half. 
Alexei: [speaking Russian] 
Joyce: Oh, what- 
(She holds the wrapper up)
Alexei: [speaking Russian] 
Murray: In Hawkins, this door had been opened once.
Alexei: [speaking Russian]
Murray: It was still... healing. 
Hopper: Jesus Christ.
Joyce: So, this door is open now? 
Murray: [speaking Russian] 
Alexei: [speaking Russian]
Murray: He says it is... opening. 
Joyce: [gasps] 
(She gets up)
Hopper: Where are you going? 
Joyce: To call our children. 
(Hopper gets up as well)
Hopper: [gasps]
Alexei: [in Russian] Can we watch Looney Tunes now? 
Murray: Nyet. 
[big band music playing]
Hopper: [panting] [grumbling] 
(He searches through cupboards and everything)
Murray: Can I help you with something? 
Hopper: Whiskey. You have whiskey?
Murray: No, but I do have vodka. 
[Hopper sighs] 
(They both down the vodka)
[Hopper inhales sharply] 
Murray: Oh! 
(Murray pours out more)
(They both down it again)
[Hopper inhales sharply] 
[Murray sighs] 
Murray: Right. 
Hopper: Right? 
Murray: [in Russian] The key, is there a way to turn it off?
Alexei: [speaking Russian] 
Hopper: But what? 
Alexei: [speaking Russian] 
Murray: But he is now... "naked."
Murray: Sorry, "exposed." Compromised. 
(Hopper grabs Alexei and looks him in the eyes)
Murray: [speaking Russian] 
Alexei: [laughs] 
(Hopper lets go of Alexei)
Murray: [speaking Russian] 
Murray: [speaking Russian]
Murray: He says he likes your courage. 
Murray: You remind him of a... [clears throat] ...fat Rambo.
Alexei: [speaking Russian] 
Murray: But he says that even thin Rambo couldn't get there.
Alexei: [speaking Russian] 
Alexei: [speaking Russian] 
Murray: Breaking in is... impossible. 
(If "Challenge Accepted" could ever be expressed in a facial expression well... Hopper just made it)
Dustin: Jackpot. 
Dustin: Oh-ho-ho! 
Erica: Do you even know how to drive? 
Dustin: How hard can it be? Max did it. 
Dustin: Aw, come on. 
(Exactly my point)
Dustin: There's gotta be a spare.
[Erica sighs] 
(She begins looking around and spots a cage)
Erica: Hey, Dustin? 
(Dustin is looking for a key)
Dustin: Yeah?
Erica: How big did you say that Demogorgon was? 
Dustin: Big. Nine feet or so. Why? 
Dustin: Found 'em. Erica? 
[loud zapping] 
(Erica is behind him with a fucking STUN CANE)
Dustin: What the hell is that?! 
Erica: A deadly weapon. Could be useful. 
(She zaps it at him again and he jumps back)
Dustin: For what? 
(They get in the vehicle)
[engine powering up]
Robin: Help! 
[Robin's voice echoes] 
Robin: Help! Help! 
Steve: [slurred] Hey, would you stop yelling?
(Steve looks around drowsily)
Steve: Is this his place of work? I love the vibe. 
[Robin chuckles] 
Steve: Charming. 
(Steve looks to his left)
Robin: No, your other right. 
(They both look to Steve’s right)
Steve: Oh. 
Robin: Yeah, okay. And do you see those scissors? 
Steve: Uh-huh. 
Steve: And I could cut the binds. 
Robin: Yeah, and we could get out of here. 
Steve: Gotcha. Okay, yeah, we can do that. 
Robin: Yeah. 
Steve: Those morons. They left scissors in here? 
Robin: Yeah, morons. [laughs] 
Steve: Total morons. Okay. 
Steve: Okay, good, hop on three. I gotcha. 
Robin: All right. One, two, three.
Robin: Okay, that worked. 
Steve: Okay.
Robin: All right. Uh, let's try again. 
Steve: Right. 
Both: One, two, three. 
(They do it again and the chair moves closer) 
Robin: Holy shit, this is gonna work! 
Steve: We're close. Ready? 
Robin: Okay, one, two, three. 
[both grunting] 
[both groaning]
Robin: [laughing lightly]
Steve: It's okay, it's okay. Don't cry. Robin. 
[Robin giggles] 
Steve: Are you laughing? 
Robin: [continues laughing] Yeah. 
Steve: Jesus! 
Steve: What? 
Steve: [sighs] 
(Steve shakes his head weakly)
[Robin chuckles] 
Steve: Yeah, I know. 
Steve: [chuckles] Yep. [laughs] 
Robin: At least it can't get any more messed up than this. 
[both chuckle]
Steve: You know, I wish I'd known you in Click's class. 
Robin: Yeah? 
Steve: Really, I do.
[Robin chuckles] 
[both chuckle] 
Robin: It was. 
[buzzer sounds] 
[door opens] 
[suspenseful music playing] 
(Ozerov, Dr Zharkov and two soldiers enter)
Ozerov: Try telling the truth this time, yes?
(He’s stroking Steve’s hair like a big weirdo)
(He pushes against a bruise on Steve’s face)
Steve: [winces]
Ozerov: [chuckles] 
(He looks at Dr Zharkov and signals him over)
Dr Zharkov: It will help you talk. 
Steve: Did you even clean that thing?! 
(Steve is injected with the strange blue drug)
[Steve screams]
[static hissing] 
[El’s gasping breaths]
[Eleven breathes rapidly] 
(She rips off her blindfold)
[gasping, panting] 
Max: What's he doing now?
Nancy: And that's not normal, right? 
Will: He wants us to find him. 
Mike: It's a trap, I agree. We'll be ambushed. 
Max: You mean El will kick their butts. 
Mike: It's too risky.
Eleven: Billy knows it. Billy's been there. To the source. 
Mike: Yeah, but- 
(Cut to – El sitting down in front of the TV)
[static hissing] 
Mike: We don't know that. 
Eleven: Mike. I need you to trust me. 
Mike: Yeah. Just... be careful.
(Eleven puts on her blindfold)
(Billy is sitting on his bed and staring forward at nothing)
Eleven: [shivering breaths] 
(She walks towards him)
[Eleven exhales sharply] 
(She takes his hand)
(He looks up at her and grabs her arm roughly)
[suspenseful synth music playing]
(El is breathing heavily)
[Eleven whimpering] 
Mike: Something's wrong. 
(Everyone looks worried)
Eleven: [screams] Stop! No! No! No! No! 
(She lands in sea water – she’s on a beach)
[seagulls squawking] 
[distorted wailing] 
Mike: [echoing] El, are you okay?
Mike: Are you okay? 
Eleven: [sighs] [softly] I'm okay. 
Mike: What's going on? 
Eleven: I'm... on a beach.
Max: What else do you see? 
[tides crashing] 
[seagulls squawking] 
(There’s a faint outline of a woman)
Eleven: A woman. She's... pretty. I... I think she's looking at me. 
[echoing laughter] 
(The woman is waving – it looks like she’s waving at El but)
Woman: Woo! 
(She claps her hands)
Woman: Yeah! 
[woman laughs] 
Woman: You did it!
(The boy puts down his surfboard, he’s smiling brightly) 
Eleven: There's... a boy. 
Boy: Did you see that? 
Woman: Yeah, I saw that! 
(She kisses the boy’s forehead)
Boy: That was at least seven feet. 
Boy: Ten more minutes? 
Woman: Yeah, okay, ten more minutes. 
Boy: Okay. 
(He runs back to his board and picks it up)
Boy: Okay!
[boy panting] 
(He’s about to go back in the water)
Woman: Billy? Watch out for rip currents! 
Billy: I know. 
Eleven: It's Billy. 
Max: It's California. It's a memory. 
[seagulls squawking] 
[distant rumbling] 
Eleven: I think I see it. The source. 
Eleven: [panting] 
(She walks towards the source)
[ominous synth music playing] 
[thunder rumbling and crashing]
[dialing on rotary phone] 
Hopper: Yeah, I want 'em to trace me. 
Murray: What? 
[Hopper clears throat] 
[phone ringing] 
Man: [answers] Philadelphia Public Library. 
Man: What is your identification code? 
Hopper: Identification code? 
Joyce: You don't know it? 
Murray: You must be joking. 
Hopper: Oh, no, no, I got it, I got it. [chuckles] I got it.
(He gets out his wallet and looks in it)
Murray: You wrote it down and kept it in your wallet? 
(Hopper finds the paper after a minute of fumbling)
Man: Your message will be relayed. 
(Jim puts the phone down) 
Joyce: So, now what? 
Hopper: Now, we, uh... 
(He gets out a cigarette and sits down on the couch)
Hopper: we wait. 
Joyce: How long do we wait? 
Hopper: As long as it takes.
Joyce: How can you just sit there being calm? 
(Uh oh, here comes another lover’s quarrel)
Hopper: I am not calm!
Joyce: Our kids are in danger! 
Hopper: You said they were at the festival! 
Joyce: Which is, like, ten minutes from the gate!
(Hopper pauses – he has a surprised look on his face)
Joyce: [scoffs] 
Hopper: What are you doing? Joyce? What are you doing? 
(Murray is contemplating his life)
[phone rings]
Man: Philadelphia Public Library.
Hopper: What are you doing?
Man: Ma'am, I'm gonna need you to stay calm. 
Joyce: [on the phone] No. Don't you dare patronize me!
(Hopper and Murray look at each other in disbelief)
Man: Yes, yes, ma'am. 
Joyce: Thank you. And good day. 
(She hangs up)
Hopper: It's been exactly one minute, Joyce. 
Joyce: That's one minute too long. 
(She goes to Alexei and wakes him up) 
Joyce: Alexei. 
Alexei: [gasps] [in Russian] What's going on? 
(She leads Alexei outside and Hopper follows behind)
Steve: Honestly, I don't really feel anything. Do you? 
Robin: I mean, I... I feel fine. I feel normal. 
Steve: Yeah, I feel- I feel fine. I kinda feel good. 
[both chuckling] 
Robin: Wanna know a secret? 
Steve: What? 
Robin: I like it, too! 
[both laugh] 
(Oh dear god they’re high)
Steve: Morons. They messed up the drug. 
Robin: They messed it up! Morons. Hey, morons! 
Steve: Morons!
Robin: Moron! Mor- 
Steve: Hey! Whoa-oh! 
Robin: Oh, no. There's definitely something wrong with us.

(In walks the dream team of Dr Zharkov and Ozerov)
[Robin chuckles]
Ozerov: Let's try this again, yes? 
Steve: [murmurs] 
(He nods)
Ozerov: Who do you work for? 
Steve: Scoops. [chuckles] Scoops Ahoy.
Robin: [giggles] 
Ozerov: How did you find us? 
Steve: Totally by accident. [chuckles] 
[Steve chuckles] 
(Ozerov looks at Zharkov)
Ozerov: [in Russian] More lies. 
(Zharkov picks up some pliers and walks over)
Steve: What is that shiny little toy?
Robin: Where you going with that, doc? 
Steve: Whoa, whoa, hey, hey. Wait! No! Wait! Wait! Whoa! 
Robin: There was a code! We heard a code! 
(Zharkov stops and looks at his partner)
Ozerov: Code. 
(He walks around to Robin and looks at her)
Ozerov: What code? 
Steve: Uh, well, Dustin knows. 
Robin: Hey, Steve? 
Steve: Yeah, Dustin Henderson, he knows.
(Jeez watch out for loose lipped Harrington over here)
Robin: Steve! 
[Steve laughs] 
Ozerov: Where is he? 
Ozerov: Is that so? 
Steve: Yeah.
[both laugh] 
Ozerov: [laughs] 
[Robin and Steve laughing]

(El is standing at the edge of the storm)
Man: Hey! Billy, stop! 
Billy: [stammering] I know. 
Neil: Wait. Afraid you're gonna get hurt, is that it? 
(El starts walking towards them – further into the storm)
Billy: No. 
Billy: Leave me alone!
(Billy breaks away from him and runs – El runs after him)
Neil: Hey! That's right, run! Like you always do! 
[lightning crackling] 
[thunderclap]
Neil: Where were you last night? Where were you? 
Billy’s Mom: I told you, I was with Wendy.
Neil: Stop lying to me! 
Billy’s Mom: I'm not lying to you! 
Neil: You saw him again, didn't you? 
Neil: Didn't you?! 
Billy’s Mom: Get away from me! 
Billy’s Mom: I said, get away! 
Neil: You- You whore!
Billy: Stop it! 
Neil: Bitch! 
Billy: Don't hurt her!
(Billy runs at his Dad to protect his mother 
Billy’s Mom: No! 
Billy: Don't hurt her! 
Billy’s Mom: You bastard! 
(Neil punches his wife and sends her falling to the ground)
Billy: Mom! 
(The memory fades away and walks further)
Max: Max. 
Neil: Shake her hand. I said, shake her hand.
(El hears the Billy that she knows)
Billy: Who's there? 
(She searches for this memory)
Billy: I said, who's there?! [screams]

Eleven: Brimborn... Steelworks. 
(Jonathan runs over to the phonebook)
Nancy: That's close. 
Mike: El, El, we found it. Get out of there. Get out.
(El rips off her blindfold)
[panting] 
(She looks around the room – there’s no one there)
Billy: [with deep voice] He can't hear you. 
Eleven: [gasps] 
(Billy walks out of Hopper’s room of all places)
Billy: You... let us in. 
Billy: And now... you are going to have to let us stay. 
Billy: Don't you see? All this time, we've been building it.
Eleven: [sobbing] 
Billy: We've been building it... for you. 
(The flayed begin to enter the Steel Works)
Billy: All that work, all that pain... all of it... for you.
[Eleven sobbing] 
(They walk down to the basement)
Eleven: No! 
Billy: And then we are going to end... everyone.
Eleven: [screaming] Get away!
(Sike, she was still in the void - the mind flayer pulled an uno reverse card and messed with her head)
(El rips off her blindfold, screaming)
Eleven: No! 
Mike: El, you're okay. It's- It's okay. El. 
Eleven: [sobbing] 
(El clings to Mike)
