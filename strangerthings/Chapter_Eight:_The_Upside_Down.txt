Script: 
[insects chirping]
[Joyce yelling - she's handcuffed in an interrogation room]
Joyce: Let me out of here! Somebody, please! [she struggles against her handcuffs and grunts] Let me out!
[door unlocking]
[Joyce breathing heavily – Brenner enters the room and approaches her]
Brenner: Your son. We know you've been in contact with him. 
Joyce: [stammering] You have to let me-
Brenner: When... and how did you make contact with him?
Joyce: What?
Brenner: Hmm? [he pauses] Six. 
Joyce: What? 
Brenner: Six. Six people have been taken this week. This... thing that took your son... [softly] we don't really understand it. But its behavior is predictable. Like all animals... it eats. It will take more sons. More daughters. I want to save them. I want to save your son. But I can't do that. Not without your help. 
Joyce: Stop. I know who you are. I know what you've done. You took my boy away from me! You left him in that place to die! You faked his death! We had a funeral. We buried him. And now you're asking for my help? Go to hell.
[in another room Hopper is tased while being harshly questioned]
[electricity crackling]
[Hopper groaning and breathing heavily]
Agent: Okay, now what do you know?
Hopper: I'm sorry. Did I stutter? I told you. Everything.
[electricity crackling – Hopper is tased again]
Female Agent: What do you know?
[Hopper panting]
Hopper: I know you do experiments on kidnapped little kids, whose parents' brains you've turned to mush. And I know you went a little too far this time and you messed up in a big way. I mean, you really messed up, didn't you? Big time. That's why you're trying to cover your tracks. You killed Benny Hammond, you faked Will Byers' death. You made it look like that little girl just ran away. [he pauses as the agents look shocked] See, I told you. I know everything.
Agent: All right, who are you working with?
Hopper: Nobody. But I did give all this over to my friend at the Times. He's gonna blow this thing wide open. [chuckles]
[electricity crackling – Hopper is tased a third time]
[groans] 
[Hopper grunting as he’s pulled off the ground by two agents and sat down]
Agent 2: You're just a junkie. A small town cop who had a really bad week. Took one too many pills this time. 
Female Agent: You made a mistake coming back here.
Hopper: No, I didn't. Here's what's gonna happen. You're gonna let me and Joyce Byers go... you're gonna give us anything we need, and we're gonna find her son. And then we're gonna forget that any of this ever happened. 
Female Agent: Oh, is that right?
Hopper: Yeah. That's right.
Mike: Nancy? Jonathan?
[door closes as he comes back inside]
Mike: They're gone.
Lucas: What? 
Mike: Nancy and Jonathan. His car's gone.
Dustin: They're probably just sucking face somewhere. 
Lucas: Gross.
Mike: No. No way! 
Dustin: Did they go with the chief?
Mike: I don't know. 
Eleven: No. 
Mike: What? Did you see them? Do you know where they went? 
Eleven: Yes.
Mike: Where? Where did they go?
Eleven: Demogorgon.
[Nancy and Jonathan pull up outside, they take everything from the trunk of Jonathan's car and bring it inside - they proceed to set up an intricate trap for the demogorgon as well as putting nails in a baseball bat and putting all the bulbs back that Hopper removed from the Christmas lights]
[Brenner enters the room that Hopper is in]
[he walks over to Hopper and gives him his cigarettes and a lighter]
Brenner: Where's the girl?
Hopper: [inhales deeply] [exhales] You gotta give me your word. Nobody's ever gonna find out about this. And those other three kids, those boys, you're gonna leave them alone. Then I'll tell you. Tell you where your little science experiment is.
Joyce: [sighs] [gasps as Hopper is brought into the room she’s being held in – she’s released from her handcuffs and they’re both lead down a hallway] I don't understand.
Hopper: We came to an agreement.
Joyce: What?
Hopper: Look, everything that's happened here and everything that's gonna happen, we don't talk about. You want Will back? This place had nothing to do with it. That's the deal. You got it?
[they’re lead into a room and given hazmat suits]
Hopper: What is this?
Scientist: Protection. The atmosphere is toxic. 
Joyce: [stutters] But my son's in there. He-
Hopper: Put it on.
[we see them coming out of the elevator in their full gear]
Female Agent: I'm telling you, this is a mistake. 
[she’s leaving the lab with a small army of armed agents and Brenner]
Brenner: It's gone. Isn't that what you wanted?
Female Agent: And if they find the boy? 
Brenner: That's not gonna happen.
[Joyce and Hopper are at the gate between the normal world and the upside down, they go through it]
[Joyce breathing heavily]
Hopper: Hey, you all right?
Joyce: Yeah.
Hopper: I need you to relax, okay? I want you to slow down your breathing, take deep breaths. In and out. Deep breath in... and out. In and out. In and out.
Hopper: It’s troll's favorite food! [playfully growling he picks up his daughter Sara] Princess!
Sarah: No, Daddy! No, Daddy!
Hopper: Roasted princess with paprika and gravy!
Sarah: No! No, Daddy. No, Daddy. 
[Hopper growling]
[Sarah breathing heavily]
Hopper: Whoa, hey! Hey.
[Sarah breathing heavily]
Hopper: You all right?
Diane: What's going on?
Hopper: Whoa. 
Diane: What happened? What happened?
Hopper: I don't know. I don't know. [he puts down Sarah carefully] Hey, you all right? Whoa, whoa, whoa. Relax, relax. Honey, honey.
[Sarah panting]
Hopper: Honey, just breathe. Breathe, breathe, breathe. In and out. Slow, slow, slow. [inhaling deeply] In and out with me. In...
Hopper: You okay?
Joyce: [breathing heavily] Yeah. Yeah.
[they walk deeper into the upside down]
Jonathan: Remember...
Nancy: Straight into Will's room. And-
Jonathan: Don't step on the trap.
Nancy: Wait for the yo-yo to move.
Jonathan: Then... [flicks the lighter] All right. You ready?
Nancy: Ready. 
Jonathan: On three.
[Jonathan and Nancy are both preparing to cut their palms]
Jonathan: One... two... [pause] You don't have to do this
Nancy: Jonathan, stop talking.
Jonathan: I'm just saying, you don't have to-
Nancy: Three.
[they both slice their palms]
Mike: Guys, guys! This is crazy. We can't just wait around. 
Lucas: Mike, in case you forgot, we're still fugitives. The bad men are still looking for us.
Dustin: Yeah, and we don't even know where your sister is.
Mike: El can find them..
Dustin: Mike, look at her. I still think we should stick to the chief's plan.
Lucas: Exactly. We stay here, keep El out of sight and keep her safe. That's the most important thing, remember? Besides, she's okay. She's with Jonathan.
Dustin: Yeah, and she's kind of a badass now, so... 
[he walks off]
Mike: Well, where are you going? You just said stick to the plan! 
Dustin: I am. I'm just gonna go get some chocolate pudding! I'm telling you, Lunch Lady Phyllis hoards that shit.
Mike: Are you serious?
Dustin: El needs to be recharged! 
[faint creaking] 
[Nancy is wrapping a bandage around Jonathan’s hand]
Nancy: Did you hear that? 
Nancy: Speak? 
Jonathan: Blink. Think of them as alarms. 
Nancy: Is that too tight? 
Jonathan: [stutters] No, it's fine. Thanks. Nancy? 
Jonathan: Yeah? 
[banging on door] 
[both gasp] 
[banging on door continues] 
[Nancy opens the door]
Nancy: Steve, listen to me. 
Steve: Hey. Nancy, what- 
Nancy: You need to leave. 
Steve: I'm not trying to start anything, okay?
Nancy: I don't care about that. You need to leave. 
Nancy: Nothing. [stutters] It was an accident. 
Steve: Yeah, what's going on? 
Nancy: Nothing. 
Steve: Wait a sec. Did he do this to you? 
Nancy: No. 
Steve: Nancy, let me in! 
Steve: What is... What the-
Jonathan: You need to get out of here. [he grabs Steve]
Steve: Whoa. What is all-
Steve: What is that smell? Is that... is that gasoline? 
Nancy: [pulls the gun on Steve] Steve, get out!
Steve: [stutters] Wait. What? What is going on? 
Nancy: You have five seconds to get out of here. 
Steve: Okay, is this a joke? Stop. Put the gun down. 
Nancy: I'm doing this for you. 
Jonathan: Nancy.. 
Steve: Wait. Is this a... What is this? 
Jonathan: Nancy. 
Nancy: Three. Two. 
Steve: No, no, no! No, no! 
Steve: Wait, what's here? 
Nancy: Where is it? 
Nancy: Where is it? 
Jonathan: I don't know. I don't see it. 
[monster roars – Nancy shoots at the monster as it comes out of the ceiling]
Jonathan: No! [he grabs her and pulls her away] Go! Go! Run! Go! [Steve is standing in shock as the monster drops from the ceiling onto the ground but Jonathan tugs his arm] Get out of here! 
Jonathan: Jump! [jumps over the bear trap] 
[both] Shut up! 
[monster screeching] 
[all panting] 
Nancy: What's it doing? 
Jonathan: I don't know. 
[electricity jolts and the hallway goes quiet] 
Nancy: Do you hear anything? 
Jonathan: No. 
[door opening – all three of them look out into the hall and see nothing]
[Joyce and Hopper search the upside down – Hopper finds something that looks like a hatched egg – Joyce moves ahead and sees the upside down’s version of Castle Byers is destroyed]
Joyce: [echoing] Will! Will! [breathing heavily] Will! Will! [indistinct sobbing] 
[Hopper sees a stuffed animal and has a moment of remembrance]
Hopper: [reading to Sarah] "I asked Mrs. Spencer what made them red and she said she didn't know and for pity's sake not to ask her any more questions. She said I must have asked her a thousand already. I suppose I had, too, but how are you gonna find things out if you don't ask questions? And what does make roads red? 'Well, I don't know,' said Matthew. It just makes me feel glad to be alive... it's such an interesting world."
[cut to]
Hopper: [sobbing in a stairwell]
[Hopper is brought out of his daze by Joyce]
Joyce: [yelling] Will! 
Hopper: Will!
[Nancy and Jonathan walk slowly down the hallway and look into the living room - there's no sign of the monster] 
[electricity pulsating] 
[both breathing heavily] 
Nancy: Where is it? 
Jonathan: Come on. Come on, you son of a bitch. You see it? 
Nancy: No. Where-
Jonathan: Come on. Where are you? Come on! 
[low growling] 
Nancy: Jonathan! 
Nancy: Jonathan! Jonathan! 
[monster growling] 
[Steve grunting – he picks up the bat and attacks the monster]
Nancy: Steve! 
[monster roars] 
Jonathan: He's in the trap! 
Steve: He's stuck! 
[monster screeching]
Joyce: Did you hear that?
[screeching continues faintly - Joyce and Hopper move through the upside down more frantically]

[Jonathan panting]

Nancy: Where's it going? 
Jonathan: I don't think that's the monster.

Lucas: Yeah. 
[in the cafeteria]
Eleven: What's "putting"? 
Eleven: Eggos? 
Eleven: Will you be like my brother? 
Mike: What? No, no. [scoffs]

Eleven: "Snow Ball"? 
Eleven: No? 
Eleven: A friend? 
[car approaching]
Mike: Nancy. Hold on, I'll be right back. Stay here. [Mike goes outside, expecting to see Nancy, but instead he's faced with the small army of armed agents from Hawkins lab - he runs back inside]

Lucas: Well, we call her "El" for short. 
Dustin: She's basically a wizard. 
Lucas: [whispers] She has superpowers. 
Mike: More like a Yoda. 
Mike: Yeah, it flipped over us
Lucas:: Then she squeezed the brains out... 
Dustin: And blood was pouring out of their faces. 
Mike: It was pouring out of their eyes.

[continues indistinctly]
