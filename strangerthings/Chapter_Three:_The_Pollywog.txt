Lucas: I don't understand. 
Mike: What do you not understand? 
Lucas: Will saw something that looked like Dart last year? 
Will: Kind of, but there was no tail.
Mike: But then he heard it yesterday. The exact same sound. 
Dustin: Why didn't you tell us before? 
Dustin: So it’s a coincidence. 
Lucas: True Sight?
Lucas: [sighs] Elaborate. 
Lucas: So that would mean... 
Mike: Dart is from the Upside Down. 
Lucas: [sighs] We have to take him to Hopper. 
Mike: I agree. 
Mike: Maybe he should be dead. 
Dustin: How can you say that? 
Mike: How can you not? He's from the Upside Down. 
Dustin: We have a bond. 
Mike: A bond? Just because he likes nougat? 
Dustin: No, because he trusts me! 
Lucas: He trusts you?
Dustin: Yes, I promised I would take care of him.
