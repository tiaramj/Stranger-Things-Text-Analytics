[nautical tune playing]
Erica: More fudge, please. 
Erica: Go on. 
Robin: All right. You see this?
(Robin holds up the blueprints that she drew a path on)
Erica: Then you find out what's in those boxes?

(Hopper pretends to be shocked)
Hopper: No shit! 
(Hopper pushes something off of Kline’s table – like a cat)
Hopper: All right, so... what exactly are we looking at? 
Kline: Land deeds, transfers of property.
Kline: I already told you, they don't tell me anything. 
Kline: These people, Jim, they're bad news. 
Hopper: So, what, this is blackmail?

Karen: And were you? 
Karen: You're what everyone thinks you are. 
Nancy: Just a kid who has no idea what she's doing. 
Karen: [sighs] It's not easy out there, Nance. 
Nancy: I know. 
(Karen sits up on the counter with Nancy) 
Nancy: Dad. 
[both laugh]

Nancy: Proud of me for getting fired? 
Nancy: Mom! 
Karen: Yes, those shitheads. 
Nancy: [chuckles, sniffles] 
Nancy: That would be... pretty amazing. 
Karen: So, why not? Why not?
