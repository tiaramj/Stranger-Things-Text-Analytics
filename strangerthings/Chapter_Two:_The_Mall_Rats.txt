[Billy grunts, screaming as he's dragged into the basement of the mill]
[distorted rat's squeals]
[sloshing noise as something attaches to Billy's face]
[Billy screams]
Phone Operator: [voice distorts] Is someone there? Hello?
[the lights flicker inside the telephone box]
[Billy puts down the phone, panting]

[Billy pants as he steps out of the telephone box]
[footsteps intensify as figures approach him]

Hopper: Hey. Is everything okay?
Eleven: Yes.
[phone ringing]
Karen: Hello, this is the Wheelers.
[Eleven speaks indistinctly]
Karen: Yeah, just a sec. Mike! Phone!
Mike: Okay! Hello?
Eleven: [sighs and goes into her room] It's 9:32. Where are you?
Mike: Sorry, I-I was just about to call. I, um... can't see you today.
Eleven: What... Why not?
Mike: It's my Nana. She's very sick.
Eleven: But Hop said that your Nana was okay, that it was a false alarm.
Mike: Yeah. That's... what... we thought it was at first, but then she took a real turn for the worse.
Eleven: Oh.
Mike: Yeah. We think she might... die.
Karen: What?
Mike: Mom! Get off the phone! How many times?!
Karen: Did Nana call?!
Mike: No, Mom! Just get off the phone!
Karen: [scoffs]
Mike: [sighs] Sorry about that.
Eleven: Was that your mom?
Mike: Yeah. She's so upset, she's making no sense. Because we have to go to the nursing home. To see Nana.
Eleven: You can come over after?
Mike; No! I mean, I-I just think... I need to be alone today. With my... feelings?
Eleven: Do you lie?
Mike: What? No. Friends don't lie. What, Mom? My mom's calling me. Better go. Talk to you tomorrow. Talk you already. Bye!
[Eleven comes out of her room and puts the phone back]
Hopper: Hey. What's going on?
[Eleven goes back into her room and slams the door]

[door bell chimes as he enters the shop]
Hopper: Emotions have been shared. Boundaries have been set. Order... has been... restored.
Joyce: Wait, wait, it worked?
Hopper: Uh, this is the first day in six long, excruciating months that they will not be seeing each other. Yes, I think it worked! Yes! 
[Joyce claps]
Hopper: [laughs] No, stop. It's all you. I'm a puppet, you're the master.
Joyce: So you remembered everything?
Hopper: [laughs] Yeah, yeah. I mean, I had to improvise a little bit, you know? It turns out, getting to Mike, now that was the key.
Joyce: And you didn't yell at him?
Hopper: I'll tell you everything over dinner. I was thinking, you know, Enzo's, tonight, 7:00. Hey, before you say no, I'd- I'd like to make one thing crystal clear. This is not a date.
Joyce: Wait, a date? You never said anything about a date.
Hopper: I know, I didn't say anything about a date. I just wanted to clear it up in case there was any confusion on your part.
Joyce: There's not.
Hopper: Great. It's just two friends getting together for a nice dinner. I mean, we've earned it, haven't we?
Joyce: I can't be out late.
Hopper: You'll be home by 9:00.
Joyce: 8:00.
Hopper: 8:30, I'll pick you up.
Joyce: I'll meet you there.
Hopper: 7:00. Enzo's. Meeting there. Deal.
[static squawks]
Powell: Hey, Chief, you copy? Chief!
Hopper: Yeah, I'm a little busy right now.
Crowd: Recall the mall!
Powell: Yeah, well, I'm busier here.
Crowd: Recall the mall!
You wanna keep your job tomorrow, I think you need to get your ass to Town Hall. Now.
Hopper:  [sighs and puts his radio away] [chuckles] Duty calls. [clears throat] Oh! Jeez. [trips over and knocks something over as he leaves] Cleanup on aisle five.
Joyce; Bye.
Hopper: See you tonight.
[Joyce goes over and sees that the magnets fell]
[she tries to put them back up but they fall right off]
[Nancy is making coffee]
[indistinct chatter in background]
[Nancy looks at the note she made the night before from the call in]
[she starts overpouring the coffee]
Nancy: Oh, shit, shit.
Bruce: Whoopsie-daisy! [guffaws] Careful there, Nancy Drew. Careful.
[men snicker]
Bruce: Pouring coffee's a tough gig, girl.
[men laugh]
[Nancy knocking]
Nancy: And here you are, two creams, two sugars.
Tom: Thanks, sweetheart.
Nancy: Of course. Tom?
Tom: Hm?
Nancy: I really hate to ask this, but do you think one of the other girls could run and grab lunch today? 
Tom: They're needed at their desks.
Nancy: I know, I just, um... I really need to go to the doctor. I've been having some... um... girl problems.
[Tom almost spits out his coffee, coughing nervously]
[he nods and Nancy leaves the office]
[Nancy walks in]
Jonathan: Oh, come on! The light!
Nancy: Let's go.
[they head outside]
Jonathan: Look, I just... I just don't know if this is such a good idea anymore.
Nancy: Really? Because I feel like it's the best idea I've had all summer. 
Jonathan: Look, all I'm saying is, what harm is there in asking? 
Nancy: The harm in asking is that Tom will say no. We ask for forgiveness, not permission. And if this story's as good as I think it's gonna be, then Tom won't care. In fact, he'll thank us.
Jonathan: Or the old lady is nuts and the story blows up in our face and Tom fires us.
Nancy: And then we never have to work at this shithole again.
[they get in Jonathan's car]

Steve: [groans, laughs] Ah!
Robin: How many children are you friends with?
Steve: [sighs]
[Dustin gets a banana split and sits with Steve]
Steve: No, no. No way. Hotter than Phoebe Cates? No.
Dustin: Mm-hmm. Brilliant, too. And she doesn't even care that my real pearls are still coming in. She says kissing is better without teeth.
Steve: [doesn't know how to react] Wow. Yeah, that's great. Proud of you, man. That's ro-- That's kinda romantic. That's like... Wow.
Dustin: Hm. So do you really just get to eat as much of this as you want?
Steve: Yeah. I mean, sure. It's not really a good idea for me, though. I gotta keep in shape for the ladies.
Robin: Yeah, and how's that working out for you?
Steve: Ignore her.
Dustin: She seems cool.
Steve: She's not. So, where are the other knuckleheads?
Dustin: They ditched me yesterday.
Steve: No.
Dustin: My first day back. Can you believe that shit?
Steve: Whoa. Seriously? I swear to God. Mm.
Dustin: They're gonna regret it, though, big time, when they don't get to share in my glory.
Steve: Glory? What glory?
Dustin: So, last night, we're trying to get in contact with Suzie...

[everyone turns to look at them]
Steve: Jeez, shh. Yeah, okay, that's what I thought you said. What- What does that mean?
Dustin: It means, Steve, we could be heroes. True American heroes.
Steve: Huh.
Dustin: Mm-hmm?
Steve: American heroes.
Dustin: Just think, you could have all the ladies you want and more.
Steve: More?
Dustin: More.

Max: Hi?
Eleven: Can we talk?
[they go into Max's room]
Eleven: And then he said he- he missed me. And then he just hung up.
Max: He's a piece of shit.
Eleven: What?
Max: Mike doesn't have jack shit to do today, and his Nana obviously isn't sick. I guarantee you, him and Lucas are playing Atari right now.
Eleven: But friends don't lie.
Max: Yeah, well, boyfriends lie. All the time.
Mike: She knows I'm lying. She knows I'm lying.
Lucas: I don't even understand. Why lie?
Mike: Hopper. He threatened me.
Lucas: Did he say he'd kill you?
Mike: What? No.
Lucas: So then, what's the big deal?
Mike: The big deal is if I don't do what he says, then he'll stop me from seeing El. Like, permanently. You don't understand, Lucas. He's crazy. [sighs] He's lost his mind.
Will: Hey, guys, I'm almost set up here.
Mike: I had no choice, Lucas. I really had no choice.
Lucas: I just wish you'd consulted me, because the way you handled this, you're in deep shit.
Max: You're going to stop calling him. You're going to ignore his calls. As far as you're concerned, he doesn't exist.
Eleven: Doesn't exist?
Max: He treated you like garbage. You're gonna treat him like garbage. Give him a taste of his own medicine.
Eleven: Give him the medicine.
Max: Mm-hmm. And if he doesn't fix this, if he doesn't explain himself, dump his ass.
[Mike groans]
Lucas: I'm not gonna lie, it's gonna be bad.
[Mike groans]
Lucas: But... you can fix this. It's just one little mistake. I've made hundreds, thousands. Max has dumped me five times. But what have I done? Huh? Have I despaired? No. I've marched back into battle, and I've won her back every single freaking time.
Mike: How?
Lucas: I'll show you. Come on.
Max: Come on.

Max: To have some fun. There's more to life than stupid boys, you know.

Karen: Thanks.

Karen: Billy? Billy? I... [sighs] I understand if you're angry with me. I just... I wanted to explain...

Karen: [echoing] ...why I didn't come last night.
Billy: [murmurs]
Karen: It's not you, it's just... I have a family.
[Billy's heartbeat pounding]
Karen: And I can't do anything that will hurt them. You can understand that, right? But I shouldn't have said that-
[Billy grunts and knocks Karen against the shelf]

Steve: It sounded familiar.
Dustin: What?
Steve: The music. The music right there at the end.
Dustin: Why are you listening to the music, Steve? Listen to the Russian! We're translating Russian!
Steve: I'm trying to listen to the Russian, but there's music-
Robin: All right, babysitting time is over. You need to get in there. [sees they've wiped off her board] Hey, my board. That was important data, shitbirds.
Dustin: I guarantee you, what we're doing is way more important than your data.
Robin: Yeah? And how do you know these Russians are up to no good anyways?
Dustin: How does she know about the Russians?
Steve: I don't know.
Dustin: You told her about-
Steve: It wasn't me.
Robin: Hello, I can hear you. Actually, I can hear everything. You are both extremely loud. You think you have evil Russians plotting against our country, on tape, and you're trying to translate, but haven't figured out a word because you didn't realize Russians use an entirely different alphabet than we do. Sound about right?
[she goes to grab the recording]
[Steve grabs it first]
Steve: Whoa! What do you think you're doing?
Robin: I wanna hear it.
Both: Why?
Robin: 'Cause maybe I can help. I'm fluent in four languages, you know.
Dustin: Russian?

Nancy: We get that a lot.
Mrs. Driscoll: [chuckles] Follow me.
Nancy: Oh, it's... it's lovely. Um, do you live here all alone?
Mrs. Driscoll: Yes. Jack, my husband, he passed away, what is it now, ten years ago. 
Nancy: Oh, um... I'm... I'm so sorry.
Mrs. Driscoll: Oh, don't be. I kinda like the quiet. At least, I did.

Mrs. Driscoll: You see those little teeth marks, don't ya?
[Jonathan takes a photo]
Nancy: And... these bags, um... you're sure they were full before?
Nancy: Are you sure they did? Maybe they just gnawed the bag? I mean... eating fertilizer seems-
Mrs. Driscoll: Crazy. Believe me, I know, honey. But... [sighs] ...something's not right with these rats.
Nancy: What does that mean, exactly... "not right"?
Mrs. Driscoll: Rabies, my guess. That's when I said to myself, "Doris, you gotta call the paper. Because if those diseased rats are runnin' loose, the people, they oughta know." Wouldn't you agree?

Kline: [laughs] Calm down, now. You don't even know what I want.
Hopper: You don't like your fan club, you want me to shut 'em down. Sound about right?
Hopper: [laughs] When'd you get so serious?
Kline: Take a seat.

Hopper: [clears throat dramatically] [grunts as he sits down]
Kline: My fan club, as you call them, now, you know why they're out there, don't ya?
Hopper: They're not actually fans?
Kline: [chuckles] They lost their jobs to the mall and blame me for helping make that happen. Now, you go ask anyone else in this town. They all love the mall. It's helped our economy grow, brought in new jobs, and just some incredible new stores. Which is why they all stopped shopping at their, uh, mom-and-pops. Now, that's not me, Jim.
Hopper: Mm-hmm?
Kline: Uh-uh. That's just, uh, good old fashioned American capitalism.
Hopper: Well, Larry, I think that they're just exercising their good old fashioned American right to protest. [grunts]
Kline: I agree.
Hopper: Yeah.
Kline: If. If they had a permit. Now, correct me if I'm wrong here, Jim, but, uh... I don't believe they secured a permit from your office, did they?
Hopper: Not that I'm aware of.
Kline: Then I do believe it's within my right to get rid of them.
Hopper: Larry, I'm not a politics guy, but I think if you force those people out of here without provocation, I don't think that's a good look for your re-election campaign.
["America the Beautiful" playing]
Kline: You know what's in four days, Jim?
Hopper: Independence Day?
Kline: That's right. And I'm gonna throw this town the biggest bash it's ever seen. Fireworks, music, activities, you name it. I'm gonna pull out all the stops. You know why? 'Cause at the end of the day, that's all the voters will remember. But I can't think, much less plan, with all that racket going on out there. So, if you don't mind, please... just do your job. Flash your little gold badge, and get rid of them.

Robin: Yeah. [in Russian accent] "The week is long."
Steve: Well, that's thrilling.
Robin: I know. But, progress.
Steve: Okay, here you go, you got a strawberry and then a vanilla with sprinkles, extra whipped cream.
[he hands an ice cream to Max and one to Eleven]
Both: Thanks.
Steve: Wait a second. Are you even allowed to be here?
[Eleven laughs and they run off]
Steve: That... Okay.
Max: You wanna trade?
[they trade ice cream]
Mike: That's ridiculous. Why can't I just...
Max: Oh, you've gotta be shitting me.
[they look and see the boys getting their bikes]
Lucas: Haven't got that much.
Mike: Okay, what if we split it?
Lucas: Split it with what? Does that even make sense?
Max: Isn't this a nice surprise.
Mike: What are you doing here?
Eleven: Shopping.
Max: This is her new style. What do you think?
Mike: What's wrong with you? You know she's not allowed to be here.
Max: What is she, your little pet?
Eleven: Yeah. Am I your pet?
Mike: What? No!
Eleven: Then why do you treat me like garbage?
Mike: What?
Eleven: You said Nana was sick.
Mike: She is. She is. She is sick. Yeah, sick- she's sick.
[Mike tries to get Lucas and Will to help]
[Will looks like 'don't get me involved please']
Lucas: She's sick. She's super sick That's why we're here, actually.
Mike: Yeah, we're shopping. Not for us, but for her, for Nana.
Lucas: For Nana.
Mike: Also, we're here to get a gift for you. Just, we couldn't find anything that suited you and I only have, like, $3.50, so it's hard.
Lucas: Super hard. It's- It's expensive.
Eleven: You lie. Why do you lie?
[bus brakes squeal]
[bus door hisses open]
[Eleven and Max look at the bus and back at the boys]
[Eleven walks up to Mike, he doesn't know what's happening]
Eleven: I dump your ass.
["Cold as Ice" playing]
[Mike looks confused]
[Max looks impressed]
♪ You're as cold as ice ♪
[both girls get on the bus and laugh]
♪ You're willing to sacrifice our love... ♪
[the boys watch the bus leave]
Will: Now can we play DandD?
Lucas: No.
[Hopper arrests some of the protesters]
Henry: He raised my property taxes, Jim. Forced me off my land.
Hopper: You can protest all you want, Henry, you've just gotta go through the proper channels first.
Henry: Nothing proper about what that man did to us! To our town!
Hopper: Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[Hopper closes the cop car door]
Flo: Special delivery!
[Flo walks over and a JC Penney bag]
Hopper: Ooh, yeah. [laughs and takes a shirt out of the bag]
Flo: That the right one?
Hopper: [chuckles] Yeah. Yeah!
Powell: That's a lot of color for you, Chief.
Hopper: It's cutting-edge stuff, all right? It's cutting-edge!
[chamber music playing]
[Hopper's car door opens, closes]
[car engine starts]
Hopper: I'll start off with a Scotch, you can make that a double.
Waiter: Very good, sir.
Hopper: And I think we'll have a bottle of red, as well.
Waiter: Very good, sir.
Hopper: And how's your "chee-anti"?
Waiter: Our Chianti is quite good.
Hopper: Chianti.
Waiter: Medium-bodied, with just a hint of cherry.
Hopper: Great. Women love cherries, huh? All right, we'll have that and two- two glasses, please, one for, uh, me and one for the lady.
Waiter: Ooh. Very good, sir.
[Hopper watches the door, waiting for Joyce to arrive]
[crickets chirping]
Joyce: And what is this again?
Mr. Clarke: This is a solenoid. It's a coil, wrapped around a metallic core, and when electricity passes through it...
Joyce: It creates an electromagnetic field.
Mr. Clarke: Exactamundo. Now for the fun part. Shall we?
Joyce: Yeah.
[electric hum]
Joyce: I... I don't see anything.
Mr. Clarke: Nope. You can't see it, but it's there, I assure you. Our very own Clarke-Byers Electromagnetic Field. Pretty neato, huh?
Joyce: Yeah.
Mr. Clarke: And this field affects any charged object in its vicinity.
Joyce: Just like my magnets.
Mr. Clarke: Just like your magnets.
Joyce: Okay, why is nothing happening?
Mr. Clarke: Oh, because our field is stable. But, if we reduce the current...
Joyce: How...
Mr. Clarke: The magnetic dipoles tried to orient according to the field, but-
Joyce: No, no, no, I mean, how is this happening at my house?
Mr. Clarke: You want my honest opinion? One of your kiddos got up in the middle of the night, bumped into the fridge, and knocked the suckers loose.
Joyce: And the magnets at Melvald's?
Mr. Clarke: Apophenia.
Joyce: Apo-what-o-whah?
Mr. Clarke: Apophenia. Uh... You're seeing patterns that aren't there. Coincidence.
Joyce: But what if... it's not?
Mr. Clarke: Well... Theoretically-speaking, I suppose some large version of this AC transformer could exist. A machine of some kind.
Joyce: A machine?
Mr. Clarke: But, in order to reach your house and downtown, gosh, that would take billions of volts of electricity and cost tens of millions of dollars.
Joyce: But it is possible.
Mr. Clarke: We cured polio in '53. Landed on the moon in '69. As I tell my students, once you open up that curiosity door, anything is possible.
Robin, Dustin, and Steve: "The week is long, the silver cat feeds, when blue meets yellow in the west."
[Steve starts closing the store]
Steve: I mean, it just... it just can't be right.
Robin: It's right.
Dustin: Honestly, I think it's great news.
Steve: How is this great news? [chuckles] I mean, so much for being American heroes. It's total nonsense.
Dustin: It's not nonsense. It's too specific. It's obviously a code.
Steve: What do you mean, a code?
Dustin: Like a super secret spy code.
Steve: That's a total stretch.
Robin: I don't know, is it?
Steve: You're buying into this?
Robin: Listen, just for kicks, let's entertain the possibility that it is a secret Russian transmission. What'd you think they were gonna say, "Fire the warhead at noon"?
Dustin: Exactly.
Robin: And my translation is correct. I know that for sure, so... "The silver cat feeds." Why would anyone talk like that unless they're trying to mask the meaning of their message?
Dustin: Exactly.
Robin: And why would anyone mask the true meaning of their message unless the message was somehow sensitive?
Dustin: Exactly.
Robin: So I guess that confirms your suspicion.
Dustin: Evil Russians.
Robin: I can't believe I'm about to agree with this strange child, but, yeah, totally evil Russians.
Dustin: So how do we crack it?
Robin: Well, I guess we translate the rest and hopefully a pattern emerges.
Dustin: A pattern. Right, like maybe "silver cat" is a meeting place?
Robin: Or a person.
Dustin: Or a weapon.
Robin: It's probably gonna take a super genius to crack it, but... Where's Steve?
Robin: Hey, Steve.
[coins clatter] 
Robin: What are you doing?
Steve: Uh, it's a quarter. I need- Do you have a quarter?
Robin: [chuckles] Sure you're tall enough for that ride?
Steve: Quarter!
[Robin tosses him a quarter and he puts it in the horse ride]
[waltz tune playing]
Robin: You need help getting up, little Stevie?
Steve: Shh!
[Dustin chuckles]
Steve: Would you two just shut up and listen?
[waltz tune continues]
Dustin: Holy shit. The music. The music!
[Dustin gets out the recorder and plays it]
[man speaking Russian]
[waltz tune playing]
Robin: I don't understand.
Dustin: It's the exact same song on the recording.
Robin: Maybe they have horses like this in Russia.
Steve: "Indiana Flyer"? I don't... I don't think so. This code, it... didn't come from Russia. It came from here.
[chamber music playing]
[Hopper watches couples being all coupley, clearly upset and jealous]
[couple laughing]
Waiter: [clears throat] Would you like to order your entrée, sir?
Hopper: [slurring] You know what, Enzo?
Waiter: My name is not Enzo.
Hopper: I just lost my appetite, all right? So, here you go. You can keep the change.
[dishes clatter]
Waiter: Sir! I'm afraid no alcohol is allowed off the premises.
Hopper: [blows raspberry] I can do anything I want. I'm the chief of police.
[Hopper leaves]
[chamber music crescendos]
[distant thunder rumbling]
[Billy's car engine revving]
[Billy gets out the car and opens the boot, revealing Heather ties up]
[Heather's voice echoes in his head]
Heather: Billy, are you okay?
[Billy remembers capturing her, Heather grunting and choking]
[he carries Heather into the steel works]
[footsteps]
[he puts her down as she wakes up]
[muffled whimpering]
[muffled whimpers]
[whimpering stops]
Billy: Don't be afraid. It'll be over soon. Just stay very still.
[Heather gasps as he takes off the tape over her mouth]
[creature snarling]
[low roaring noise]
[screeching]
[screams]
Heather: No!
[Heather screams]
[creature roars]
