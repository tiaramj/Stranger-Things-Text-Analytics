Script: 
[Joyce speeds to the school and parks outside]
Dustin and Max: Will!
Dustin: Will!
Joyce: Dustin!
Dustin: Mrs. Byers?
Joyce: What's going on? Where's Will?
[Lucas runs in and pants] 
Lucas: The field!
[they run outside to see Will stood still with Mike]
Mike; Will. I just found him like this! I think he's having another episode!
[Joyce pulls him close]
Joyce: Will! Will! Will! Sweetie, wake up! It's Mom! Will!
[Will chokes in the Upside Down]
Joyce: Will, wake up! Can you hear me?
[Will continues choking in the Upside Down]
Joyce: Will, please, just wake up. Please, wake up!
[Will keeps choking in the Upside Down]
Joyce: It's Mom! It's me!
[Will keeps choking until he suddenly opens his eyes and gasps]
[Joyce leads Will to the car]
[Max, Dustin, Mike and Lucas follow them out]
Max: Okay, that totally freaked me out. Did that not freak you guys out?
Lucas: Two episodes in two days.
Mike: It's getting worse.
Lucas: You think it's True Sight?
Max: What's True Sight?
[car engine starts]
[Mike shakes his head at Lucas] 
Lucas: It's nothing.
[Will and Joyce sit at a table]
Will: I can't remember.
Joyce: [sighs] I need you to try.
Will: I... I was on the field and.. and then it... it all just went blank, and... and then you were there.
Joyce: Will, I need you to tell me the truth.
Will: [stutters] I am.
[Joyce sighs and gets the drawing from the tape]
Joyce: This shape, I saw it on the video tape from Halloween night. It's the same shape as... as your drawing. [sighs] These episodes that you're having, I think Dr. Owens is wrong. I think they're real. But... but I can't help you if I don't know what's going on. So, you have to talk to me. Please. No more secrets, okay?
Will: Okay.
Joyce: Did... did you see this thing again on the field?
Will: Yes.
Joyce: What... what is it?
Will: I don't know. [stammering] It's almost more like a feeling.
Joyce: Like the one you had that night at the arcade?
Will: Yes.
Joyce: [stutters] What does it want?
Will: I don't know. It came for me, and... And I tried. I tried to make it go away. But it got me, Mom.
Joyce: Well, what does that mean?
Will: [crying] I felt it... everywhere. Everywhere. I- I still feel it. [sobbing] I just want this to be over.
Joyce: It's okay. It's okay. Hey. Listen. Look, look at me. I will never, ever let anything bad happen to you ever again. Whatever's going on in you, we're gonna fix it. I will fix it. I promise. I'm here.
[Will shuddering]
[Eleven walks up to the house]
[Hopper is waiting outside]
Hopper: "Friends don't lie." Isn't that your bullshit saying? Hey, hey! Hey! Don't walk away from me!
[Eleven storms inside and Hopper follows to her room]
Hopper: Where'd you go on your little field trip, huh? Where? Did you go see Mike?
Eleven: He didn't see me.
Hopper: Yeah, well, that mother and her daughter did and they called the cops. Now, did anyone else see you? Anyone at all? Come on, I need you to think!
Eleven: Nobody saw me!
Hopper: You put us in danger. You realize that, right?
Eleven: You promised... I go! And I never leave! Nothing ever happens!
Hopper: Yeah! Nothing happens and you stay safe!
Eleven: You lie!
Hopper: I don't lie! I protect and I feed and I teach! And all I ask of you is that you follow three simple rules. Three rules. And you know what? You can't even do that!
[Hopper walks out and Eleven bangs on her dresser]
Hopper: You're grounded. You know what that means? It means no Eggos... And no TV for a week.
[Hopper tries to lift the TV but Eleven keeps it in place]
Hopper: All right, knock it off. Let go. [grunts]  Okay. Two weeks. Let go! A month!
Eleven: No!
[Hopper pulls out the cord and Eleven runs over]
Eleven: No! No! No. No!
Hopper: You have got to understand that there are consequences to your actions.
Eleven: You are like Papa!
Hopper: Really? I'm like that psychotic son of a bitch? Wow! All right. You wanna go back in the lab? One phone call. I can make that happen.
Eleven: I hate you.
Hopper: Yeah, well, I'm not so crazy about you, either. You know why? 'Cause you're a brat. You know what that word means? How about that be your word for the day, huh? Brat. Why don't we look it up? B-R-A-T. Brat.
[he throws her the dictionary and she throws it back at him with her powers]
Hopper: Hey! What the hell is wrong with you?
[he grunts as she rams the couch into him]
Hopper: Hey! Hey! 
[Eleven storms into her room and slams the door]
Hopper: Hey! Hey! Open this door! Open the damn door! You wanna go out in the world? You better grow up! Grow the hell up!
[Eleven screams, breaking all the windows, and then sobs on the floor]
[Jonathan drives up and parks]
[he looks around the house]
Jonathan: Mom? Will? Hello?
[he opens Will's door and sees them asleep]
Mike: Do you like those grapes, Holly?
[Nancy goes to the toaster]
Nancy: Hey, Mom, I was thinking about staying the night at Stacey's tonight? We were gonna have a girl's night. Romantic comedies, do our nails, gossip... 
Karen: Sure! That sounds like fun.
[Nancy heads back to the table and looks at Holly]
[TV playing indistinctly]
Nancy: Toast? No?
[Nancy walks towards Jonathan's car with a bag]
[she gets in the car and puts her bag in the backseat]
Jonathan: Hey.
Nancy: Hey. Did you see your mom?
Jonathan: No, she was sleeping. But I left a note.
Nancy: You don't have to do this, you know.
Jonathan: Stop saying that.
[he starts driving]
[Joyce is on the phone, calling the station]
[line ringing]
[Joyce sighs]
Flo: Hawkins Police.
Joyce: Flo, it's Joyce again.
Flo: Oh, hi, Joyce. Listen, I gave him your message-
Joyce: He's still not there?
Flo: No, but-
Joyce: Did he get any of my messages from yesterday? Did you give-
Flo: Yes, do you wanna talk to-
Joyce: No, no, I need Hopper. Just tell him to call me the second he gets in. Please. Thank you.
Flo: Bye.
[Joyce hangs up and sighs]
[Will walks into the kitchen]
Joyce: Hey. How you feeling, sleepyhead? Any better? 
Will: Mmm-mmm.
Joyce: Same as last night? Still weird?
Will: Yeah.
Joyce: All right. [sighs] Hmm. [puts a thermometer in his mouth] Okay, let me see. 
Will: Is it a fever?
Joyce: No. Uh, actually, it's cold. Do you feel cold?
Will: No. Just a little out of it. Like I haven't really woken up yet. You promised no doctor.
Joyce: And I meant it. No doctor. You know what? I'm gonna run you a nice bath and it'll warm you up and hopefully get you feeling better. How's that sound? Okay.
[Joyce goes and starts running a bath]
Dustin: Morning, Dart. Got you some breakfast. Your favorite. 
[Dustin breaks up a Muskateers bar in the tank]
Dustin: I gotta go to school, but I'll be back soon. Sound good?
[Dart chitters]
[Dustin parks his bike and looks around]
[he hears Mike and walks over]
Mike: Stop being a baby and do it already!
Max: This is so disgusting. Is this really necessary?
Dustin: What the hell's going on?
Mike: What do you think? We're looking for Dart.
[a bag of rubbish flies out of the bin]
Dustin: Jesus!
Max: Oh!
Mike: Ugh!
[Lucas grunts and jumps out]
Lucas: Well, well, well. Look who finally decided to show up. After I drew the short straw. Real convenient. 
Max: You stink!
[Max walks away from Lucas, towards Dustin]
Dustin: Hi, Max.
Max: Hi.
Dustin: Where's Will?
Mike: He'll be here.
Lucas: Are you just gonna stand there? [throws Dustin a stick] Or you gonna help?
[they start prodding through the rubbish]
Mr. Clarke: All living things, from complex mammals to single-celled organisms, instinctively respond to danger. Expose a bacterium to a toxic chemical, and it will flee. Or deploy some other defense mechanism. We're very much the same. When we encounter danger, our hearts start pounding. 
[water dripping as it cuts to show Will walking to the warm bath]
Mr. Clarke: Our palms start to sweat. These are the signs of the physical and emotional state we call... fear.
[Joyce is on the phone]
Hopper: Hey, you reached Jim. I'm probably doing something incredible right now and I can't...
Will: Mom.
Joyce: Yeah, sweetie, what is it?
Will: It's too hot.
Joyce: [sighs] I... I can cool it down a little bit, baby, but we gotta get your body temp back up.
Will: No.
Joyce: What?
Will: He likes it cold.
[Will walks off]
[Hopper hammers wood to the empty window frames]
Hopper: Hey, kid. Listen, um... about last night, I, uh... I want this place cleaned up by the time I get back and then maybe I'll consider fixing the TV. You hear me? 
[door opens and closes as he leaves]
[Hopper walks to his truck]
[Flo is heard on the radio] 
Flo: Come in, Hop. Come in, Hop. Come in, Hop.
Hopper: [grunts softly] Yeah. Yeah, I'm on my way in, and, yes, I do know what time it is.
Flo: Joyce Byers has called eight times already this morning. Eight times. For my sake, please deal with her!
[Hopper drives to the Byers house]
[whistle blows]
[Steve and Billy's class is playing basketball, Steve is losing to Billy]
Coach: Let's go. Pass it up now. Get open!
Billy: [laughs] All right! All right, all right! King Steve. King Steve, everyone. I like it. Playing tough today.
Steve: Jesus! Do you ever stop talking? Come on!
Billy: [laughs] What? You afraid the coach is gonna bench you now that I'm here? Huh?
[Steve grunts as Billy knocks him over]
[Billy scores]
Billy: You were moving your feet. Plant them next time, draw a charge.
[whistle blows]
[the boys go to the showers]
Billy: Don't sweat it, Harrington. Today's just not your day, man.
Billy: Don't take it too hard, man. A pretty boy like you has got nothing to worry about. Plenty of bitches in the sea. Am I right? I'll be sure to leave you some.
[Nancy and Jonathan are sat on a bench]
[indistinct chatter]
[Jonathan sighs]
Nancy: It's 15 past.
Jonathan: Yeah, I know. Just give him time.
Nancy: That guy. There.
Jonathan: What?
Nancy: He just... just talked to himself.
[children shouting indistinctly]
Child: Duck, duck, duck, duck, duck...
[indistinct chatter while Jonathan and Nancy look around]
Child: Duck, duck, duck... Duck, duck, duck... Duck...
[kids laugh as Nancy notices more people looking their way]
Child: Duck, duck... Goose!
Nancy: I think we should go.
[they head to Jonathan's car, one stranger following them]
[Nancy and Jonathan get in the car]
[he tries to start the car but it keeps stalling]
[Nancy gasps as someone knocks on the car window]
Man: Trouble with your car, miss? I can give you two a lift if you like.
Nancy: Jonathan.
[they notice they're being surrounded]
Man: You sure you don't need that ride?
[Hopper drives and parks]
Hopper: Hello?
Joyce: Leave it open. Where the hell have you been?
Hopper: I overslept. What the hell's going on? It's freezing.
[they go to Will's room]
Joyce: Hey! Knock, knock. We have a visitor.
[Hopper and Joyce sit with Will]
Hopper: So this thing, this shadow thing. You told your mom it likes it like this. It likes it cold?
Will: Yeah.
Hopper: How do you know that?
Will: I just know.
Hopper: Does he talk to you?
Will: No. It's like... I don't have to think. I just know things now. Things I never did before.
Hopper: And, uh... what else do you know?
Will: It's hard to explain. It's like old memories in the back of my head, only... they're not my memories.
Hopper: Okay.
Will: I mean, I don't think they're old memories at all. They're... they're now-memories, happening all at once, now.
Hopper: Can you describe these now-memories?
Will: I don't know. It's... it's hard to explain.
Joyce: I know it's hard but can you just... Can you try? For us?
Will: It's like... They're growing and spreading... killing.
Joyce: The memories?
Will: I don't know.
Joyce: Oh!
Will: [crying] I'm sorry.
Joyce: No, no, no. It's okay, sweetie. Hey, hey, sweetie... what if you didn't have to use words?
[Will gets out paper and crayons and starts drawing]
[phone ringing]
[continues ringing]
[Will is on the phone, calling Joyce]
[Joyce is heard on the answering machine] 
Joyce: Hey, you've reached the Byers. We're sorry...
[Mike puts the phone down and rushes to Lucas]
Lucas: Anything?
Mike: We need to talk. AV room. Right now. 
[Dustin, Lucas, Max and Mike start to head inside]
Mike: [turns around] Party members only.
Dustin: Come on, Mike.
Mike: No! This is non-negotiable.
Lucas: Sorry, Max.
Dustin: Sorry.
[the boys head to the AV club]
Mike: Will didn't want me to tell anyone, but on Halloween night he saw a sort of shadow in the sky.
Lucas: A shadow? [stammers] What kind of shadow?
Mike: I don't know. But it scared him. And if Will really has True Sight... I mean, if he can really see into the Upside Down, maybe he saw that shadow again yesterday.
Dustin: So that's why he was frozen like that?
Mike: Maybe.
Lucas: Can it hurt him? I mean, if this shadow thing isn't from our world...
Mike: I'm not sure. Dustin?
Dustin: Well, if you're in another plane, you can't interact with the material plane, so theoretically, no, the shadow can't hurt him.
Mike: Yeah, if that's even what's happening. This isn't D and D. This is real life.
Lucas: So what do we do?
Mike: We acquire more knowledge. I'll go to Will's after school. See what's going on. You guys stay here and find Dart.
Dustin: Dart? What's he gotta do with this?
Mike: Will heard him in the Upside Down. I don't know how yet, but he's gotta be connected to all this. He's gotta be. If we find Dart, maybe we can solve this thing. Maybe we can help Will.
[Eleven looks at the broken TV and sighs]
[she picks up the dictionary and blows the glass off it]
[Eleven starts cleaning up the cabin]
[as she cleans, she finds the storage under the floor]
[she gets out the box marked <i>HAWKINS LAB</i> and looks through the box]
[Nancy and Jonathan are sat in an interrogation room]
[Nancy gets up and looks at the camera]
Nancy: Hey! Hey, assholes! Let us out of here!
[Owens comes into the room]
Owens: Oh! Not very pleasant in here, is it? Sorry about that. Hospitality's not our strong suit. You know, scientists and all. Yeah. Okay. You up for a little walk? I'm assuming you're behind me.
[Owens walks out followed by Nancy and Jonathan]
[door opens]
[Owens walks through the facility talking with Nancy and Jonathan]
Owens: "Men of science have made abundant mistakes of every kind." George Sarton said that. You guys know who George Sarton is? Doesn't really matter. The point is, mistakes have been made. Yes. 
Nancy: Mistakes?
Owens: Yes.
Nancy: You killed Barbara.
Owens: Abundant mistakes, but, the men involved with those mistakes, the ones responsible for what happened to your brother and Miss Holland's death, they're gone. They're gone, and for better for worse, I'm the schmuck they brought in to make things better. But I can't make things better without your help.
Nancy: You mean without us shutting up?
Owens: [sighs] She's tough, this one. You guys been together long?
Jonathan: We're not together.
Owens: Wanna see what really killed your friend?
[he leads them into the gate room]
Owens: Teddy, I brought you an audience today. I hope you don't mind.
Teddy: More the merrier, sir.
[Owens points to the gate]
Owens: I'd call it one hell of a mistake. Wouldn't you? See, the thing is, we can't seem to erase our mistake... but we can stop it from spreading. Like, it's like pulling weeds. But imagine for a moment if a foreign state, let's say, the Soviets... If they heard about our mistake... do you think they would even consider that a mistake? What if they tried to replicate that? The more attention we bring to ourselves, the more... the more people like the Hollands know the truth, the more likely that scenario becomes. You see why I have to stop the truth from spreading, too. Just, same as those weeds there. By whatever means necessary.
[screeching is heard as someone burns the entrails of the gate]
Owens: So, we understand each other now, don't we?
[Will is still scribbling away]
[Joyce brings some of the papers through to the living room]
Joyce: This is more of the same.
Hopper: Oh, it's nothing. It's just scribbles.
Joyce: Wait!
Hopper: What? What?
Joyce: Wait. Wait. These black lines, see?
Hopper: What?
[Joyce puts two papers together]
Joyce: Look, they connect. They connect.
[Hopper moves furniture around, grunting]
[they connect all the pages together like a giant jigsaw]
Hopper: Does this mean anything to you?
Joyce: No. [sighs] I mean, is it some sort of maze or a road? [stammers] I mean, it's sort of forking and branching like... like lightning.
Hopper: You think it's that storm?
Joyce: No, the storm he drew was completely different. He used red. And this is all blue and it has some weird dirt color. I mean, maybe it's roots. 'Cause remember, he was saying it was spreading and-
Hopper: Killing. He said they were killing. Vines. He's drawing vines. 
[Hopper grabs his hat and coat and leaves quickly]
[ringing]
Lucas: Hey, Max. Have you seen Dustin? We're supposed to meet after class.
[Max slams her locker closed and walks off]
Lucas: Max! Hey, Max! Hey, where you going? Come on! We've gotta go look for Dart.
Max: Yeah, good luck with that.
Lucas: What is wrong with you?
Max: What is wrong with me? What's wrong with you?
Lucas: I don't understand.
Max: No! I don't understand! You guys act like you want me to be your friend but then you treat me like garbage!
Lucas: That's not true!
Max: Yes, it is! You go and hide in the AV Club, keeping secrets like we're in second grade or something. You know, I thought you guys wanted me in your party.
Lucas: We do. But it's...
Max: But what?
Lucas: [sighs] There... there are just things. Things we can't tell you, all right? For your own safety.
Max: My own safety?
Lucas: Yes!
Max: Because I'm a girl?
Lucas: What? No!
Max: Did you keep secrets from El?
Lucas: How do you know about El?
Max: Did you?
Lucas: That was different. Trust me. Okay? That was just... just different.
Max: Okay. You know what? Forget it, okay? I don't wanna be in your stupid party anyway. I'm out. Have a nice life.
Lucas: Max!
Max: You still stink, by the way!
Lucas: [sniffs] Oh, shit!
[Max heads over to Billy's car]
Billy: That kid you were talking to, who is he?
Max: He's no one.
Billy: No one?
Max: This kid from my class.
[they get in Billy's car and he lights a cigarette]
Billy: Why was he talking to you?
Max: It was just about a stupid class assignment.
Billy: Then why're you so upset?
Max: I'm not!
Billy: He causing you trouble?
Max: Why do you care?
Billy: Because, Max, you're a piece of shit, but we're family now whether we like it or not, meaning I'm stuck looking out for you.
Max: What would I ever do without-
Billy: Hey! This is serious shit, okay? I'm older than you. And something you learn is that there are a certain type of people in this world that you stay away from, and that kid, Max... That kid is one of them. You stay away from him, you hear me? Stay away.
[engine starts]
[Hopper drives up and gets a shovel out of his truck]
[he walks into the pumpkin patch and starts digging]
[Eleven looks through the box marked '<i>HAWKINS LAB'</i>]
[she picks out a red folder marked '<i>IVES, TERRY'</i>]
Eleven: "Ives. Terry." 
[she reads through the newspaper clippings]
Eleven: Jane. Papa.
[Eleven gets up and grabs the radio, turning it on]
[she sits on the floor with it and a picture of Terry Ives and Dr Brennan]
Radio News Host: ...President Reagan's...
[stations changing]
[upbeat song playing]
[radio static]
[Eleven covers her eyes and holds the picture to her chest]
[Terry mumbling indistinctly]
Terry: Three to the right. Four to the left.
[Eleven walks closer to her]
Terry: Rainbow. Three to the right. Four to the left.
[Eleven stands in front of Terry, who's rocking in her chair]
Terry: Rainbow. Three to the right. Four to the left. Four-fifty...
[Terry opens her eyes and looks at Eleven]
Terry: Jane.
Eleven: Mama?
[Eleven touches her and Terry disappears]
Eleven: Mama! [crying] Mama?
Eleven: [crying] Mama! [shrieking] Mama! Mama... [sobbing] Mama!
[Mike knocks on the door]
Mike: Hello? Will! Mrs. Byers?
[door unlocks]
Mike: [sighs] Hey.
Joyce: Hey, Mike.
Mike: Is Will here?
Joyce: You know what? Now is not a really good time.
Mike: Is he okay?
Joyce: [sighs] Yeah. You know, he's... he's just not feeling real well. He's laying down, so I'll tell him you stopped by, okay?
Mike: It's about the shadow monster, isn't it?
[Nancy and Jonathan are being walked to a car by one of the men from the park]
Man: Have a nice day.
[the man hands Jonathan the keys]
[Jonathan and Nancy get in Jonathan's car]
[engine starts]
[Jonathan drives away and Nancy gets out the tape recorder from her bag]
[tape whirring]
[clicks]
Owens: Doesn't really matter. The point is, mistakes have been made. Yes.
Nancy: Mistakes?
[tape forwarding]
Owens: The men involved with those mistakes, the ones responsible for what happened to your brother and Miss Holland's death, they're gone...
[tape rewinding]
Owens: ...the ones responsible for what happened to your brother and Miss Holland's death, they're gone.
[clicks]
Jonathan: You still wanna do this?
Nancy: Let's burn that lab to the ground.
[Jonathan drives, leaving Hawkins]
Claudia: Mew-mew, dinner! Where are you? Mew-mew! 
[Dustin rushes into the house]
Claudia: Hey, Dusty!
Dustin: Hi, hey. Hey, Mom.
Claudia: Everything okay?
Dustin: Yeah, everything's fine. Yeah.
[Dustin heads into his room and locks the door]
Dustin: Dart, I've gotta talk to you, buddy. It's about my friend, Will. [panting] I think...
[he takes off the blanket covering the tank and see's the glass has smashed]
[Dustin picks up something like a shed snake skin]
Dustin: What the hell?
[Dart screeching]
[Dustin turns around and looks at the open wardrobe]
Dustin: Dart?
[Dart continues grunting]
[Dustin walks over, seeing the black stains on the carpet]
[he looks behind the chair and sees Dart eating Mews]
[Dart looks up at Dustin, much bigger now, and opens his 'mouth', screeching]
[Hopper is still digging]
[Hopper grunting]
[squelching]
[panting]
[Hopper grunts as he attacks the thing under the soil with the shovel]
[air hissing]
[bubbling]
[breathing heavily]
[he grunts as he climbs into the hole he made, arriving in a giant tunnel]
[continues breathing heavily]
Hopper: Oh Jesus.
[he looks around, seeing the floating things from the Upside Down in the air around him]
