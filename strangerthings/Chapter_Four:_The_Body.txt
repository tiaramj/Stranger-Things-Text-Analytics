Script: 
[indistinct chatter]
[Powell and Hopper check the house with flashlights]
Powell: This the wall she was talking about, Chief.
[cuts to Hopper talking to Joyce after his search]
Hopper: (distorted) A trooper found something in the, uh... water that's at the quarry. Our working theory right now is that Will... crashed his bike, he... made his way over the quarry and, uh... accidentally fell in. The earth must have given way. Joyce? (speaking clearly) Joyce? Do you understand what I'm saying?
Joyce: No. (trembling) Whoever you found... is not my boy. It's not Will.
Hopper: Joyce.
Joyce: (stammering) No, you don't understand. I talked to him... a half hour ago. (sniffles) He was... He was here. He was... He was talking with these.
[Joyce leads Hopper to the cupboard and the tangled xmas lights]
Hopper: Talking?
Joyce: Uh-huh. One blink for yes, two for no. And... And, uh... (stammering) And then I made this so he could talk to me. 'Cause he was hiding... from that... that thing.
Hopper: The thing that came out of the wall? The thing that chased you?
Joyce: Yeah. Yeah.
Jonathan: Mom, come on, please. You've gotta stop this.
Joyce: No, maybe he's... It's after him! He's in danger. We have to find him! We-
Hopper: What exactly was this thing? It was some kind of animal, you said?
Joyce: Uh, no, it was... It was almost... human, but it wasn't. It... It had these long arms and... it didn't have a face. 
Hopper: It didn't have a face? Joyce.
[Jonathan walks away and Hopper tries to sit Joyce down]
Joyce: It didn't have a face...
Hopper: Joyce, listen to me. Listen to me. After Sarah... I saw her, too. And I heard her. I didn't know what was real. And then I figured out that it was in my mind. And I had to pack all that away. Otherwise, I was gonna fall down a hole... that I couldn't get out of.
Joyce: No, you're... you're talking about grief. This is different.
Hopper: I'm just saying that you-
Joyce: No, I know what you're saying, Hop. (hoarsely) I swear to you, I know what I saw. (sniffles) And I'm not crazy.
Hopper: I'm not saying that you're crazy.
Joyce: No... (stammers) You are. (stammers) And I understand, but... God, I... I need you to believe me.
Hopper: Please. (whispers) Please. Listen... I think you should go to the morgue tomorrow and see him for yourself. It'll give you the answers that you need. -But tonight...
Joyce: Oh, God.
Hopper: I want you to try to get some sleep, if you can.
[sniffles]
[Hopper leaves]
[car engine starts]
[car engine stops]
[Hopper leans back and sighs]
[Joyce goes out to the shed and grabs an axe. She comes back to the living room and sits on the sofa with it]
[Karen and Ted watch the news report]
Reporter: Byers' body was found in the water of this quarry by state police earlier this evening. It was discovered by state trooper David O'Bannon, just after dark. The state police are mounting an investigation to determine Byers' cause of death, but an initial inquiry...
[reporter continues indistinctly]
Ted: Should I go down and talk to Michael?
Karen: Give him time. He'll come to us when he's ready.
[Karen and Ted hold hands, Karen crying]
[Mike looks through drawings]
[Eleven plays with the radio]
[static crackling on radio]
[feedback whines]
[crackling continues]
Mike: Can you please stop that?
[radio turns off]
[radio turns on]
[static crackling]
Mike: Are you deaf? I thought we were friends, you know? But friends tell each other the truth. And they definitely don't lie to each other. You made me think Will was okay, that he was still out there, but he wasn't. He wasn't! Maybe you thought you were helping, but you weren't. You hurt me. Do you understand? What you did sucks. Lucas was right about you. All along.
[static crackling on radio]
[Will over radio]
Will: â™ª So come on and let me know  Should I stay or should I go? Should I stay or should I go now? Should I stay or should I go now? If I go there will be trouble If I stay it will be double 
Mike: Will, is that you? It's Mike! Do you copy? Over.
[static crackling]
Mike: Will, are you there?
[static]
Mike: Will!
[interference on radio]
Mike: Was that... Was it...
Eleven: Will.
Will: Mom...
[Joyce wakes up and gasps]
[she sighs, seeing nothing]
Will: (distorted) Mom!
[Joyce sees Will in front of her]
[Will is replaced with Jonathan]
Jonathan: Mom! Wake up.
Joyce:(stammers) What... what time is it?
Jonathan: It's almost 8:00. We have to go.
Joyce: Go where? Where?
Jonathan: To see Will.
[knocking on door]
Karen: Michael? Hi, honey. How are you feeling?
Mike: I, uh... I don't think I can go to school today.
Karen: Oh, that's fine, sweetie. I need to drop off Nance, then I'm gonna check in on Barb's parents. Why don't you grab a book or something and come with me? We can stop by the video store on the way back, pick out whatever you want. Even R-rated.
Mike: I think I just want to stay home today. I mean, if that's okay?
Karen: Well, are you sure you're gonna be all right here by yourself?
Mike: I think so.
Karen: Okay. But if you need anything, call Dad at work. Okay.
Mike: Okay.
[Karen kisses Mike's head]
Mike: Bye.
Karen: Bye, sweetie.
[Mike grabs the radio and tries to radio Lucas once Karen leaves]
Mike: Lucas, do you copy? Lucas, come on, I know you're there! This is urgent. I'm serious. I'm not gonna stop until you answer. Lucas. Lucas! Lucas, Lucas, Lucas, Lucas, Lucas... Lucas, Lucas, Lucas, Lucas, Lucas, Lucas, Lucas-
Lucas: (on the radio) Go away, Mike. I'm not in the mood, all right? Over and out.
Mike: No, not "out." I'm not messing around, okay? This is about Will. Over.
Lucas: What about Will? You mean about his funeral? Over.
Mike: No, not his funeral. Screw his funeral!
Lucas: What?
Mike: Just get over here stat. And bring Dustin. Over and out.
[Hopper sighs in the waiting area] 
Hopper: What's taking so long?
Patty: Well, everything's been a bit chaotic around here without Gary.
Hopper: Without Gary? Where's Gary?
Patty: Well, I thought you knew. Those men from State, they... they sent Gary home last night.
Hopper: So who did the autopsy?
Patty: Someone from State.
[cuts to Joyce and Jonathan]
[Jonathan coughs and runs off when the body is unveiled]
Joyce: He has a birth mark on his right arm. Can you show that to me, please?
[cuts the Hopper and Jonathan in the waiting area]
Hopper: How's your mom doing?
Jonathan: I don't know.
Hopper: How long's this stuff been going on? With the lights and, uh... Will and the thing in the wall?
Jonathan: Since the first phone call, I guess. You know, she's had anxiety problems... in the past. But this... I don't know. (breathes deeply) I'm worried it could be... Ugh, I don't know. She'll be okay. We'll be okay. My mom... she's tough. 
[Hopper chuckles]
Hopper: Yeah, she is. Hey. She is.
Coroner: Ma'am! Ma'am, I need you to sign!
[Joyce bursts into the room followed by the coroner]
Joyce: I don't... I don't know what you think that thing is in there, but that is not my son!
Hopper: Joyce, wait a second.
Joyce: No!
Jonathan: Mom!
Coroner: Ma'am, I- Ma'am!
[Joyce leaves, quickly followed by Jonathan]
[school bell ringing]
[indistinct chatter]
Steve: So, wait a sec. I don't understand. You went back to my house?
Nancy: To look for Barb.
Steve: Yeah, okay, but why didn't you just talk to me? That's crazy.
Nancy: I don't know, I... I was scared.
Steve: You seriously think you saw a guy in a mask just hanging out in my yard?
Nancy: I don't think it was a mask.
Steve: But he had no face?
Nancy: I don't know! I don't know, I just... I have a terrible feeling about this.
Steve: Oh, this is bad. This is really bad.
Nancy: What?
Steve: The cops... they're gonna want to talk to all of us now. Tommy, Carol, everybody who was at the party.
Nancy: So?
Steve: My parents are gonna murder me!
Nancy: Are you serious right now?
Steve: You don't understand. My dad's a grade-A asshole.
Nancy: Barb is missing! And you're worried about your dad?
Steve: Okay, just... When you talk to the cops, just... don't mention the beers. It's just gonna get us both in trouble, and Barbara's got nothing to do with it, okay?
Nancy: (scoffs) I can't believe you right now. I can't believe you.
Steve: Nancy. 
[Nancy walks off]
Steve: Nancy, wait! Nancy!
[Joyce is walking while Jonathan drives beside her]
Jonathan: Mom, will you get in?
Joyce: No, I... (stammers) I need to think. Just go on home.
Jonathan: Mom, will you just get in, please? Mom. Mom Mom. Stop.
Joyce: Just go home, Jonathan.
Jonathan: No, this is not an okay time for you to shut down.
Joyce: Shut down? What...
Jonathan: We have to deal with this, Mom. We have to deal with the funeral!
Joyce: The funeral? For... for who? For that thing back there?
Jonathan: Okay, let me get this straight. Will, that's not his body, because he's in the lights, right? And there's a monster in the wall? Do you even hear yourself?
Joyce: I know it sounds crazy. I sound crazy!
Jonathan: Yeah.
Joyce: You think I don't know that? It is crazy! But I heard him, Jonathan He talked to me! Will is... is calling to me! And he's out there, and he's alone, and he's scared, and I... I don't care if anyone believes me! I am not gonna stop looking for him until I find him and bring him home. I am going to bring him home!
Jonathan: (yelling) Yeah, well, while you're talking to the lights, the rest of us are having a funeral for Will! I'm not letting him sit in that freezer another day!
[Jonathan panting]
[Joyce walks off]
[Jonathan looks at the people watching]
Jonathan: All right, show's over. What?
[radio frequencies tuning]
[indistinct whimpering]
Mike: We keep losing the signal, but you heard it, right? 
Lucas: Yeah, I heard a baby. 
Mike: What? 
Lucas: Mike, you obviously tapped into a baby monitor. It's probably the Blackburns' next door. 
Mike; Uh, did that sound like a baby to you? That was Will! 
Lucas: Mike... 
Mike: Lucas, you don't understand. He spoke last night.  Words! He was singing that weird song he loves. Even El heard him! 
Lucas: Oh, well, if the weirdo heard him, then I guess-
Dustin: Are you sure you're on the right channel? 
Mike: I don't think it's about that. I think, somehow, she's channeling him. 
Dustin: Like... like Professor X. 
Mike: Yeah. 
Lucas:  Are you actually believing this crap? 
Dustin: I don't know, I mean... Do you remember when Will fell off his bike and broke his finger? He sounded a lot like that. 
Lucas: Did you guys not see what I saw? They pulled Will's body out of the water. He's dead!
Dustin: Well, maybe it's his ghost. Maybe he's haunting us. 
Mike: It's not his ghost. 
Lucas: So how do you know that? 
Mike: I just do! 
Lucas: Then what was in that water?
Mike: I don't know! All I know is Will is alive. Will is alive! He's out there somewhere. All we have to do is find him. 
[static crackling on radio]
Mike: This isn't gonna work. We need to get El to a stronger radio.
Dustin: Mr. Clarke's Heathkit ham shack. 
Mike: Yeah.
Lucas: The Heathkit's at school. There is no way we're gonna get the weirdo in there without anyone noticing. I mean... look at her.
[Mike grabs Nancy's make-up box and puts make-up on her]
[Dustin and Lucas look through boxes for a costume for her]
[Eleven comes out once she's dressed up]
Dustin: Wow. She looks-
Mike: Pretty. Good. You look pretty good.
[Eleven looks at herself in the mirror in the hallway]
Eleven: (whispers) Pretty. Good.
[scientists prepare someone Shepard to go through the gate]
Scientist: Clear.
Shepard: You boys hear me all right in there?
Ground Controller: Loud and clear, Shepard.
Brenner: Good luck in there, son.
[low growling]
[Brenner watches Shepard walk towards the gate and touch it]
[monster growling]
[Shepard walks into the gate]
English teacher: "The brown current ran swiftly out of the heart of darkness, bearing us down towards the sea with twice the speed of our upward progress. And Kurtz's life was running swiftly, too-"
Principal: Nancy Wheeler? If you'll come with me, please?
Powell: This argument you and Barbara had? What exactly was it about?
Nancy: It wasn't really an argument. Barb just wanted to leave. I didn't, so, I.. I told her to just go home.
Powell: Then what?
Nancy: Then I went upstairs to put on some dry clothes.
Powell: And the next day, you went back and... saw a bear, you're thinking?
Nancy: I don't know what it was, but... I think... I think maybe it took Barb. You need to check behind Steve's house-
Callahan: We did. There's nothing there. There's no sign of a bear.
Powell: And no car.
Nancy: What?
Callahan: Look. We figure that Barbara came back last night and then she took off, went somewhere else.
Powell: Has she ever talked to you about running off? Leaving town, maybe?
Nancy: No. No, Barb wouldn't do that, ever.
Powell: She wasn't maybe upset about the fact that you were spending time with this boy? Uh, Steve Harrington?
Nancy: What? No!
Callahan: Maybe she was jealous because she saw you go up to Steve's room?
Nancy: It wasn't like that.
Callahan: Like what?
Nancy: Steve and me, we're... we're just friends. We... we just talked.
Callahan: Now was this before or after you changed out of your clothes?
[everyone looks at Nancy]
Hopper: So, Gary, tell me about these troopers that brought in Will.
Gary: It was about six of 'em, I'd say.
Hopper: They're all Staties?
Gary: Yes, sir. Never seen that many troopers come with a body before.
Hopper: They told you that they were gonna take care of the autopsy, huh?
Gary: Yeah. Claimed jurisdiction. Kicked me out Well, it all seemed a bit over the top to me, considering...
Hopper: Considering what?
Gary: Considering this was Will Byers and not John F. Kennedy.
[indistinct chatter on TV]
[Hopper sighs]
Hopper: Thanks for stopping by, Gary.
Gary: Sure thing.
[Gary leaves and Hopper focuses on the TV] 
O'Bannon: ...let the people know that, uh, the troopers are on duty and you should be safe, because we think this is just an isolated incident.
Reporter: State trooper David O'Bannon, thank you so much for your help.
O'Bannon: Thank you, sir.
Reporter: Back to you...
[Will, Dustin and Lucas lead Eleven through the school]
Mike: Okay, remember, if anyone sees us, look sad.
PA: Attention students, there will be an assembly to honor Will Byers in the gymnasium now. Do not go to fourth period.
[they run to the AV room]
Mike: It's locked.
Lucas: What?
Dustin: Hey, do you think you can open it? With your powers?
Mr. Clarke: Boys?
Lucas: Hey.
Mr. Clarke: Assembly's about to start.
Mike: We know. We're just, you know... 
Lucas: Upset.
Dustin: Yeah, definitely upset.
Mike: We need some alone time.
Dustin: To cry.
Mr. Clarke: Yeah, listen... I get it. I do. I know how hard this is, but let's just be there for Will, huh? And then... 
[Mr. Clarke tosses the keys to Mike]
Mr. Clarke: The Heathkit is all yours for the rest of the day. What do you say?
[he sees Eleven and stammers] 
Mr. Clarke: I don't believe we've met. What's your name?
Eleven: Eleven-
Mike: Eleanor! She's my, uh-
Lucas: Cousin-
Dustin: Second cousin.
Mike: She's here for Will's funeral.
Mr. Clarke: Ah, well, welcome to Hawkins Middle, Eleanor. I wish you were here under better circumstances.
Eleven: Thank you.
Mr. Clarke: Uh, where are you from exactly?
Eleven: Bad place-
Dustin: Sweden!
Mike: I have a lot of Swedish family.
Dustin: She hates it there.
Lucas: Cold!
Dustin: Subzero.
Mr. Clarke: Shall we?
Lucas: Yep!
[they head to the gym]
Principal: At times like these... it is important that we come together as a community. We come-
[Dustin throws open the doors]
Dustin: Abort.
[they try to escape but Mr. Clarke herds them inside]
Principal: We come together to heal... we come together to grieve...
Karen: You lied to the police!
Nancy: I didn't lie!
Karen: How naive do you think I am? You and Steve were just talking?
Nancy: We slept together! Is that what you want to know? It doesn't matter!
Karen: It does matter!
Nancy: No! It is all bullshit! It has nothing to do with Barb and she's missing. And something terrible happened to her. I know it. I know it! And no one is listening to me!
Karen: Sweetie, sweetie, I'm listening. I'm listening to you-
Nancy: No! You're not!
Karen: Nancy... Nancy!
Nancy: Just leave me alone!
[Karen sighs]
[Nancy goes to her room, crying]
[she goes through Jonathan's pictures and finds the one of Barb on the diving board]
[she puts together the photo and sees the creature behind Barb]
[devices beeping]
Brenner: Try him again.
Ground Controller: Shepard, come in. Confirm comm.
[static crackling on radio]
Ground Controller: Shepard, come in. Confirm comm.
[static crackling]
[Shepard talks on the radio]
Shepard: This is Shepard. Confirming, over.
Brenner: Shepard. Where are you? Can you describe to us what it is you see? Over.
Shepard: It's low visibility. I'm about one click south of the rift. Everything's still here, but it's all eroded. Covered in blood...
[indistinct growling on radio]
Brenner: Shepard? Do you copy?
[Shepard breathing heavily]
Brenner: Shepard? Can you hear me?
Shepard: There's something else... There's something else in here!
[monster growling on radio]
[siren blaring]
Brenner: Reel him in. Reel him back in!
Scientist: Get him in. Come on, come on! Faster!
Shepard: There's something else in here! Pull me out! Pull me out, pull me out! Pull me out! Pull me out!
[monster growling]
[men shouting indistinctly as the tether thrashes about and suddenly goes limp]
Ground Controller: Shepard, come in. Over.
Scientist: Comms are down, sir.
Ground Controller: Shepard, come in! Over.
[the tether is reeled back to reveal Shepard isn't attached anymore]
[monster growling]
Principal: Will Byers' death is an unimaginable tragedy. Will was an exceptional student and a wonderful friend to all of us. It's impossible to express the hole his loss will leave in our community. I'd like to introduce you to Sandy Sloane. She's a local grief counselor from the church over in Jonesboro. But before she comes up here, I just want those of you who are having trouble dealing with this tragic loss...
Mike: Look at these fakers.
Lucas: They probably didn't even know his name till today.
[Troy chuckling]
[James laughs]
James:  What?
Troy: Who is interested in this? This is so stupid. Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah... Oh, he was such a great student.
[James mock crying]
Troy: Oh, he's going to leave a hole in the community.
Eleven: Mouth breather.
[indistinct mocking continues]
[the assembly ends and the students start to leave]
[Mike heads over to Troy and James]
Mike: Hey! Hey! Hey, Troy! Hey, Troy! You... you think this is funny?
Troy: What'd you say, Wheeler?
Mike: I saw you guys laughing over there. And I think that's a real messed up thing to do.
James: Didn't you listen to the counselor, Wheeler? Grief shows itself in funny ways.
Troy: Besides, what's there to be sad about, anyway? Will's in fairyland now, right? Flying around with all the other little fairies. All happy and gay!
[Troy imitating a fairy]
[Mike pushes Troy over as he walks away]
[Troy grunts]
[all exclaiming]
Troy: You're dead, Wheeler! Dead!
[indistinct murmuring as Troy stops]
Kid: Dude, Troy peed himself.
[all laughing]
[Troy panting, frozen]
Dustin: Holy shit!
Principal: Hey! What's going on here?
Lucas: Oh. Mike! Let's go!
Funeral Director: It's made of soft wood with a crepe interior. Uh, now, I... I don't know what your budget is, but over here, we... we have copper and bronze.
[Jonathan sighs]
[Nancy appears in the doorway]
Jonathan: (stammers) Can you just give me a second?
Funeral Director: Of course.
Jonathan: Hey.
Nancy: Hey. Your mom, um... she said you'd be here. I just... (inhales deeply) Can we talk for a second?
[they sit together and Jonathan looks at the photo]
Jonathan: It looks like it could be some kind of perspective distortion, but I wasn't using the wide angle. I don't know. It's weird.
Nancy: And you're sure you didn't see anyone else out there?
Jonathan: No. And she was there one second and then, um... gone. I figured she bolted.
Nancy: The cops think that she ran away. But they don't know Barb. And I went back to Steve's... and I thought I... saw something. Some... weird man or... I don't know what it was. I'm sorry. I... I shouldn't have come here today. I'm... I'm so sorry.
Jonathan: What'd he look like?
Nancy: What?
Jonathan: This man you saw in the woods. What'd he look like?
Nancy: (stammers) I don't know. It was almost like he... he didn't have-
Jonathan: Didn't have a face?
Nancy: How did you know that?
[indistinct chatter]
O'Bannon: Aw, come on!
Hopper: Another, please. And another for my, uh, friend here.
O'Bannon: Oh, thanks, man. Appreciate it.
Hopper: Yeah, that's all right. I'm, uh... I'm celebrating. My daughter, she won the spelling bee today. 
O'Bannon: (chuckling) Is that right?
Hopper: Yeah, that's right. "Odontalgia." That was the word. You know what it means? It's a fancy name for a toothache. Yeah, she's smart. She's real smart. Don't know where she gets it from. I've been tryin' to figure that out for years.
O'Bannon: Your daughter, she got a name?
Hopper: What?
O'Bannon: Your daughter? What's her name?
Hopper: Sarah. Her name's Sarah.
O'Bannon: To Sarah.
Hopper: I recognize you. Are you famous or somethin'?
O'Bannon: Uh, you might have seen me on TV, I, uh... I found that Byers boy.
Hopper: So, you on that case or what?
Hopper: So that quarry, that's, uh... that's state-run, where they found the boy, huh?
O'Bannon: Yeah.
Hopper: (chuckling) Yeah, well, that's funny. 'Cause, you know, I know for a fact that it's run by the Sattler Company. Frank Sattler? Decent guy, still got a couple operational quarries up in Roane.
O'Bannon: Is that right?
Hopper: Yeah. That's right. So why are you lying to me, man?
O'Bannon: What's your problem, bud?
Hopper: I don't have a problem. I'm just a concerned citizen.
O'Bannon: Yeah? Well, stick your nose someplace else. The kid is dead. End of story. Thanks for ruining the game, dick.
[Hopper drinks and follows O'Bannon outside]
[punches him]
[O'Bannon grunting]
[Hopper panting]
Hopper: Okay... Let's try this one more time. Who told you to be out there? What were you doing out there?
O'Bannon: I don't know! I don't know. They... they just told me to call it in and not let anybody get too close.
Hopper: Get close to what?
O'Bannon: The body.
Hopper: Who do you work for? The NSA? Hawkins Lab?
[O'Bannon looks at someone in a car]
Hopper: Who is that?
[engine starts]
O'Bannon: You're gonna get us both killed. Who is that? Hey! Hey!
[Hopper aims his gun at the car driving away]
[tires screeching]
[Hopper panting]
[he realises O'Bannon's run off]
[Joyce plays Should I Stay Or Should I Go]
Joyce: Come on! Come on! Talk to me! I know you're here!
[Mike locks the door]
Mike: Come on.
Lucas: Now what?
Mike: She'll find him. Right, El?
[radio frequencies tuning]
[Eleven remembers her time in the lab]
[water pouring]
Brenner: Eleven? Are you listening? That man before you... I need you to find him.
Eleven: (softly) Hurt him?
Brenner: No. No, I don't want you to hurt him. I want you to listen to him.
Eleven: Listen?
Brenner: Yes. I want you to listen to what he say and repeat his words back to me. Just like we used to with those old nursery rhymes. Do you remember? Hmm? Do you think you can do that for me?
Eleven: Mmm-hmm.
Brenner: Good.
Man on PA: Begin.
Man: Amulet. Frigid. Evolve. Airplane.
Brenner: Eleven? Repeat the words.
Man: Apricot. Peninsula. Game. Enchantment. Mouse. Balloon.
[cuts back to the AV club room]
Mike: She's doing it. She's finding him!
Dustin: This is crazy.
Lucas: Calm down. She just closed her eyes.
[boys gasp as the light goes out]
Dustin: Holy...
[clanging]
[clanging intensifies]
Dustin: What is that?
[radio tuning]
[clanging continues]
["Should I Stay or Should I Go" playing]
[clanging]
[Joyce turns off the music to hear it better]
[clanging]
[child whimpering]
[voice echoes]
Will: Mom?
Joyce: Will?
[Will on radio]
Will: Mom?
Lucas: No way!
Will: Mom...
Joyce: Will!
Will: Please...
Joyce: Will!
[Joyce runs outside]
Joyce: Will! Will... Will!
[Joyce runs back inside]
Will: Mom!
Joyce: Will! I'm here! I'm here! Oh, God...
[Joyce rips the wallpaper]
Will: Mom!
Mike: Will!
Lucas: Will, it's us! Are you there?
Dustin: Can you hear us? We're here!
Will: Hello? Mom?
Lucas: Why can't he hear us?
Mike: I don't know!
Joyce: Baby...
Will: Mom?
Joyce: Oh, God. Will!
Will: Mom!
Joyce: Oh, thank God. Baby... Will...
[monster growling]
Will: Mom... Mom, it's coming!
Joyce: Tell me where you are! How do I get to you?
[cuts to the AV Club, who can hear Will too]
Will: It's like home, but it's so dark... It's so dark and empty. And it's cold! Mom? Mom!
Joyce: Listen to me! I swear I'm gonna get to you, okay? But right now, I need you to hide.
Will: Mom, please!
Joyce: No, no, listen! Listen, I...
[growling continues]
Joyce: I will find you, but you have to run now! Run! Run!
[monster screeching]
[fuse blowing]
[boys yelp]
[boys exclaiming]
[fire alarm ringing]
[Dustin grabs the fire extinguisher as Eleven almost faints]
[alarm ringing]
Mike: El, are you okay?
Lucas: Oh!
Mike: Can you move? Here, help her up.
[cuts to Joyce grunting and chopping a hole in her wall where she saw Will]
[birds chirping outside the Byers Home]
[Joyce sobs softly]
[cuts back to Hawkins Middle School, the alarm still ringing]
Mike: This way!
Nancy: And you're...
Jonathan Brightening. Enlarging.
Nancy: Hmm. Did your mom say anything else? Like, um, where it might have gone to, or...
Jonathan: No, just that it came out of the wall.
[machine dings]
[Jonathan sighs]
Nancy: How long does this take?
Jonathan: Not long.
Nancy: Have you been... doing this a while?
Jonathan: What?
Nancy: Photography?
Jonathan: Yeah. I guess I'd rather observe people than, you know... Talk to them. I know. It's weird.
Nancy: No! No, it is.
Jonathan: It's just, sometimes... people don't really say what they're really thinking. But you capture the right moment... it says more.
Nancy: What was I saying?
Jonathan: What? 
Nancy: When you took my picture.
Jonathan: I shouldn't have taken that. I'm, uh... I'm sorry. It's just-
[Nancy looks at the improved image]
Nancy: That's it. That's what I saw.
[Jonathan gasps]
Jonathan: My mom... I thought she was crazy 'cause she said... that's not Will's body. That he's alive. 
Nancy: And if he's alive- 
Jonathan: Then Barbara.
Hopper: Hey, Patty!
Patty: Hey, uh, need something, Chief?
Hopper: Oh, you know, I forgot my hat. I'll just be a minute.
[Hopper walks in the other direction when Patty looks down]
Hopper: Hey, I love that book. It's a nasty mutt.
Trooper: Hey, you can't be back here.
Hopper: Yeah, I just got off the line with O'Bannon. He said that he needs to see you at the station. It's some emergency...
Trooper: What the hell are you talking about? I don't work with O'Bannon.
Hopper: Did I say O'Bannon? I meant...(smacks lips) Okay.
[Hopper punches Trooper]
[both grunt]
[Hopper panting, grabs the keys and find the body]
[he presses on the chest and gasps]
[exhales heavily and gets out his knife]
[breathing heavily as he makes an incision]
[pulls out cotton from the stomach]
[car approaching]
[Joyce groans and wakes up]
[Joyce goes outside as Lonnie exits his car]
Lonnie: Babe... Jesus, the hell happened?
[Joyce sobbing]
[they hug]
Joyce: Lonnie.
[Hopper drives and stops outside the fence]
[gets out the car with bolt cutters and starts cutting the fence]
