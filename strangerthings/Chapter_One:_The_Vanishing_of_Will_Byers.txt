[low growling]
[screaming]
Mike: Something is coming. Something hungry for blood. A shadow grows on the wall behind you, swallowing you in darkness. It is almost here
Will: What is it?
Dustin: What if it's the Demogorgon? Oh, Jesus, we're so screwed if it's the Demogorgon.
Lucas: It's not the Demogorgon.
Mike: An army of troglodytes charge into the chamber!
Dustin: Troglodytes?
Lucas: Told ya. (chuckling)
[snorts]
[all chuckling]
Mike: (softly) Wait a minute. Did you hear that? That... that sound? Boom... boom... (yells) Boom!
[slams table]
Mike: That didn't come from the troglodytes. No, that...that came from something else. The Demogorgon!
[all groaning]
Dustin: We're in deep shit.
Mike: Will, your action!
Will: I don't know!
Lucas: Fireball him!
Will: I'd have to roll a 13 or higher!
Dustin: Too risky. Cast a protection spell.
Lucas: Don't be a pussy. Fireball him!
Dustin: Cast Protection!
Mike: The Demogorgon is tired of your silly human bickering! It stomps towards you. Boom!
Lucas: Fireball him!
Mike: Another stomp, boom!
Dustin: Cast Protection!
Mike: He roars in anger!
[all clamoring]
Will: Fireball!
[die clattering]
Mike: Oh, shit!
Lucas: Where'd it go? Where is it?
Will: I don't know!
Dustin: Is it a 13?
Will: I don't know!
Lucas: Where is it?
Dustin: Oh, my God!
Karen: Mike!
Dustin: Oh, my God! Oh, my God!
Karen: Mike!
Lucas: Can you find it yet?
Will: No, I can't find it!
Karen: Mike!
Dustin: Oh, my God! Oh, my God!
Mike: Mom, we're in the middle of a campaign!
Karen: You mean the end? Fifteen after.
[Mike runs after his mom]
Lucas: Oh, my God! Freaking idiot!
Will: Why do we have to go?
Mike: Mom, wait, just 20 more minutes.
Karen: It's a school night, Michael. I just put Holly to bed. You can finish next weekend.
Mike: But that'll ruin the flow!
Karen: Michael--
Mike: I'm serious, mom. The campaign took two weeks to plan. How was I supposed to know it was gonna take ten hours?
Karen: You've been playing for ten hours?
Mike: Dad, don't you think that 20 more--
Ted: I think you should listen to your mother.
[static crackling on TV]
Ted: (grunts) Dang dumb piece of junk.
Will: Oh, I got it! Does the seven count?
Lucas: It was a seven? Did Mike see it? Then it doesn't count.
Dustin: Yo, hey guys. Does anyone want this?
Lucas and Will: No.
Nancy: Yeah. No, I don't think... Yeah, he's cute. Barb, no, I don't think so. Barb, you're not--
Dustin: Hey, Nancy. There's a slice left if you want it. Sausage and pepperoni!
Nancy: Hold on.
Dustin: There's something wrong with your sister.
Richie: What are you talking about?
Dustin: She's got a stick up her butt.
Lucas: Yeah. It's because she's been dating that douchebag, Steve Harrington.
Dustin: Yeah, she's turning into a real jerk.
Mike: She's always been a real jerk.
Dustin: Nuh-uh, she used to be cool. Like that time she dressed up as an elf for our elder tree campaign.
Mike: Four years ago!
Dustin: Just saying.
Lucas: Later.
Will: It was a seven.
Mike: Huh?
Will: The roll, it was a seven. The Demogorgon, it got me. (grunts) See you tomorrow.
Lucas: Good night, ladies.
Dustin: Kiss your mom 'night for me. Race you back to my place? Winner gets a comic.
Will: Any comic?
Dustin: Yeah. Hey! Hey! I didn't say "go"! Get back here! I'm gonna kill you!
Will: I'll take your X-Men 134!
Dustin: Son of a bitch.

Donna: (on TV) And that's it for News Center this morning. Thanks for joining us. Let's hand off now to Liz at the news desk
Liz: (on TV) All right, thank you, Donna. Turning now to local news, we're getting reports of surges and power outages all across the country. Last night, hundreds of homes in East Hawkins were affected, leaving many residents in the dark. The cause of the outage is still unknown. We reached out to Roane County Water and Electric, and a spokesperson says that they are confident power will be restored to all remaining homes within the next several hours.

[inhales and exhales deeply]
Hopper: Mmm.
[sighs]
Donna: (on TV) In other news, you might wanna stay home tonight or at least pack an umbrella. We turn to everybody's favorite morning weather guy, Charles.
[birds chirping]
Joyce: Where the hell are they? Jonathan?
Jonathan: Check the couch!
Joyce: Ugh, I did. Oh... Got them. Okay, sweetie, I will see you tonight.
Jonathan: Yeah, see you later.
Joyce: Where's Will?
Jonathan: Oh, I didn't get him up yet. He's probably still sleeping.
Joyce: (sighs) Jonathan, you have to make sure he's up!
Jonathan: Mom, I'm making breakfast.
Joyce: I told you this a thousand times. Will! Come on, honey. It's time to get up. He came home last night, right?
Jonathan: He's not in his room?
Joyce: Did he come home or not?
Jonathan: I don't know.
Joyce: You don't know?
Jonathan: No. (stammering) I got home late. I was working.
Joyce: You were working?
Jonathan: Eric asked if I could cover. I said yeah. I just thought we could use the extra cash.
Joyce: Jonathan, we've talked about this.
Jonathan: I know, I know.
Joyce: You can't take shifts when I'm working.
Jonathan: Mom, it's not a big deal. Look, he was at the Wheeler's all day. I'm sure he just stayed over
Joyce: (sighs) I can't believe you. I can't believe you sometimes.
[phone ringing]
Nancy: That's disgusting.
Mike: You're disgusting.
Karen: Hello?
Joyce: (over the phone) Hi, Karen. It's Joyce.
Karen: Oh, Joyce, hi.
Nancy: What the hell, Mike?
Ted: Hey!
Karen: Quiet!
Ted: Language.
Nancy: Are you kidding?
Joyce: (over the phone) Was that Will I heard back there?
Karen: Will? No, no, no. It's just Mike.
Joyce: (over the phone) Will didn't spend the night?
Karen: (over the phone) No, he left here a little bit after 8:00.
Karen: Why? He's not home?
Joyce: (over the phone) Um, you know what? I think he just left early for... for school. Thank you so much. Bye.
Karen: (over the phone) Okay. Bye.
[school bell ringing]
Mike: That's weird. I don't see him.
Lucas: I'm telling you, his mom's right. He probably just went to class early again.
Dustin: Yeah, he's always paranoid Gursky's gonna give him another pop quiz.
Troy: Step right up, ladies and gentleman. Step right up and get your tickets for the freak show. Who do you think would make more money in a freak show?
Troy: Midnight, Frogface, or Toothless.
[sighs]
James: (mimicking Dustin) I'd go with Toothless.
Dustin: I told you a million times, my teeth are coming in. It's called cleidocranial dysplasia.
James: (mimicking Dustin) "I told you a million times".
[chuckles]
Troy: Do the arm thing.
James: Do it, freak!
[bones cracking]
[James and Troy groan]
Troy: God, it gets me every time.
Lucas: Assholes.
Mike: I think it's kinda cool. It's like you have superpowers or something. Like Mr. Fantastic.
Dustin: Yeah, except I can't fight evil with it.
[bell ringing]
Barbara: So, did he call?
Nancy: Keep your voice down.
Barbara: Did he?
Nancy: I told you, it's not like that. Okay, I mean, yes he likes me, but not like that. We just...made out a couple times.
Barbara: "We just...made out a couple times." Nance, seriously, you're gonna be so cool now, it's ridiculous.
Nancy: No, I'm not.
Barbara: You better still hang out with me, that's all I'm saying. If you become friends with Tommy H. Or Carol--
Nancy: Oh, that's gross! Okay, I'm telling you, it was a one-time... Two-time thing.
[chuckles]
Barbara: You were saying?
Nancy: Steve...
Steve: Mmm-hmm?
Nancy: I have to go.
Steve: In a minute.
[bell ringing]
Nancy: Steve. I really, like... Seriously, I have to go.
Steve: Wait, wait, wait. Let's... Come on, let's do something tonight, yeah?
Nancy: Uh... No, I can't. I have to study for Kaminsky's test.
Steve: Oh, come on. What's your GPA again? 3.999...
Nancy: Kaminsky's tests are impossible.
Steve: Well, then, just let me help.
Nancy: You failed chem.
Steve: C-minus.
Nancy: Well, in that case...
Steve: So I'll be over around, say, like, 8:00?
Nancy: Are you crazy? My mom would not--
Steve: I'll climb through your window. She won't even know I'm there. I'm stealthy, like a ninja. 
Nancy: You are crazy.
Steve: Wait, wait, wait. Just... Okay, forget about that. We can just... We can just, like, chill in my car. We can find a nice quiet place to park, and...
Nancy: Steve... I have to study. I'm not kidding.
Steve: Well, why do you think I want it to be nice and quiet?
Nancy: You're an idiot, Steve Harrington.
[sighs]
Nancy: Meet me at Dearborn and Maple at 8:00. To study.
[bell ringing]
Flo: Good of you to show.
Hopper: (slurring) Oh, hey, morning, Flo. Morning, everybody.
Powell: Hey, Chief.
Callahan: Damn! You look like hell, Chief.
Hopper: Oh, yeah?
Callahan: (chuckles) Yeah.
Hopper: Well, I looked better than your wife when I left her this morning.
[officers laughing]
Flo: While you were drinking or sleeping, or whatever it is you deemed so necessary on Monday morning, Phil Larson called. Said some kids are stealing the gnomes out of his garden again.
Hopper: Oh, those garden gnomes again. Well, I'll tell you what, I'm gonna get right on that.
Flo: On a more pressing matter, Joyce Byers can't find her sons this morning.
Hopper: (muffled) Mmm. Okay, I'm gonna get on that. Just give me a minute.
Flo: Joyce is very upset.
Hopper: Well, Flo, Flo, we've discussed this. Mornings are for coffee and contemplation.
Flo: Chief, she's already in your--
Hopper: Coffee and contemplation, Flo!
Joyce: I have been waiting here over an hour, Hopper.
Hopper: (sighs deeply) And I apologize again.
Joyce: I'm going out of my mind!
Hopper: Look, boy his age, he's probably just playing hookie, okay?
Joyce: No, not my Will. He's not like that. He wouldn't do that.
Hopper: Well, you never know. I mean, my mom thought I was on the debate team, when really I was just screwing Chrissy Carpenter in the back of my dad's Oldsmobile, so...
Joyce: Look, he's not like you, Hopper. He's not like me. He's not like...most. He has a couple of friends, but, you know, the kids, they're mean. They make fun of him. They call him names. They laugh at him, his clothes--
Hopper: His clothes? What's wrong with his clothes?
Joyce: I don't know. Does that matter?
Hopper: Maybe.
Joyce: Look, he's...he's a sensitive kid. Lonnie...(sighs) Lonnie used to say he was queer. (softly) Called him a fag.
Hopper: Is he?
Joyce: He's missing is what he is.
Hopper: When was the last time you heard from Lonnie?
[scoffs]
Joyce: Uh, last I heard, he was in Indianapolis. That was about a year ago. But he has nothing to do with this.
Hopper: Why don't you give me his number?
Joyce: You know, Hopper, he has nothing to do with this. Trust me
Hopper: Joyce, 99 out of 100 times, kid goes missing, the kid is with a parent or relative.
Joyce: (stammers) What about the other time?
Hopper: What?
Joyce: You said, "99 out of 100". What about the other time, the one?
Hopper: Joyce.
Joyce: The one!
Hopper: Joyce, this is Hawkins, okay?
[sighs]
Hopper: You wanna know the worst thing that's ever happened here in the four years I've been working here? Do you wanna know the worst thing? It was when an owl attacked Eleanor Gillespie's head because it thought that her hair was a nest.
Joyce: Okay, fine. I will call Lonnie. He will talk to me before he talks to--
Hopper: What, a pig?
Joyce: A cop! (voice breaking) Just find my boy, Hop. Find him!
Man: Dr. Brenner.
Scientist: This way, gentleman. The entire east wing will be evacuated within the hour. We've sealed off this area following quarantine protocol.

Martin: She can't have gone far.
[growls]
[music playing faintly]
Benny: All right, and one more.
Man: Hey, Ben. What do you think about that, uh...
Benny: Hey, I don't know. I don't know.
Man: I don't know, 37 points per game average--
Benny: Thirty-seven now, but...
Man: Mr. Basket.
[indistinct chatter]
Benny: Hey! Come here! Hey, come here! You think you can steal from me, boy? What in the hell?
[bell ringing]
Mr. Clarke: Remember, finish chapter 12 and answer 12.3 on the difference between an experiment and other forms of science investigation. This will be on the test, which will cover chapters 10 through 12. (trailing off) It will be multiple choice with an essay section.
Mike: So, did it come?
Mr. Clarke: Sorry, boys. I hate to be the bearer of bad news, but... it came.
Mike: Yes!
Mr. Clarke: The Heathkit ham shack.
Mike: Whoa.
Mr. Clarke: Ain't she a beaut?
Dustin: I bet you can talk to New York on this thing.
Mr. Clarke: Think bigger.
Lucas: California?
Mr. Clarke: Bigger.
Mike: Australia?
[boys exclaiming]
Lucas: Oh, man! When Will sees this, he's totally gonna blow his shit.
Mr. Clarke: Lucas!
Lucas: Sorry.
[Dustin chuckles]
[radio tuning]
Mike: (Australian accent) Hello, this is Mike Wheeler, president of Hawkins Middle AV Club.
Lucas: What are you doing?
Dustin: (Australian accent) Hello, this is Dustin, and this is the secretary and treasurer of Hawkins Middle AV Club. Do you eat kangaroos for breakfast?
[Mike laughs]
[knock on door]
Principal Coleman: Sorry to interrupt, but, uh, may I borrow Michael, Lucas and Dustin?
[overlapping chatter]
Hopper: Okay, okay, okay. One at a time, all right? You. You said he takes what?
Mike: Mirkwood.
Hopper: Mirkwood?
Mike: Yeah.
Hopper: Have you ever heard of Mirkwood?
Callahan: I have not. That sounds made up to me.
Lucas: No, it's from <i>Lord of the Rings</i>.
Dustin: Well, <i>The Hobbit</i>.
Lucas: It doesn't matter.
Dustin: He asked!
Lucas: (mockingly) "He asked!"
Mike: Shut up, guys!
Hopper: Hey, hey, hey! What'd I just say?
Lucas: Shut up
Hopper:  One at a damn time. You.
Mike: Mirkwood, it's a real road. It's just the name that's made up. It's where Cornwallis and Kerley meet.
Hopper: Yeah, all right, I think I know that--
Mike: We can show you, if you want.
Hopper: I said that I know it!
Mike: We can help look.
Dustin: Yeah.
Hopper: No.
[boys clamoring]
Hopper: No. After school, you are all to go home. Immediately. That means no biking around looking for your friend, no investigating, no nonsense. This isn't some Lord of the Rings book.
Dustin: <i>The Hobbit</i>.
Lucas: Shut up!
Dustin: Hey!
Mike: Stop it!
[boys bickering]
Hopper: (softly) Do I make myself clear? Do I make myself... clear?
Mike and Dustin: Yes, sir.
Lucas: Yeah.
Joyce: RIng-a-ding-ding! Anybody home?
Will: Password?
Joyce: Uh, Rada... (stammering) Radaga-- Radagast?
Will: Yeah. You may enter.
Joyce: Thank you, sir. So, guess what? I got off early and... Ta-da! <i>Poltergeist.</i>
Will: I... I thought I wasn't allowed to see it.
Joyce: I changed my mind. As long as you don't have nightmares for a week.
Will: No, I won't. I don't get scared like that anymore.
Joyce: Oh, yeah? Not even of clowns?
Will: No.
Joyce: What about my witch? Ooh...
Will: No. Mom... I'm not five anymore.
Joyce: But Will Byers... I'm going to cook you up in my--
Will: Stop. That's so stupid. Mom!
[sighs]
Jonathan: Will? (shouting) Will?
Joyce: Will?
Jonathan: Will?
Joyce: Will!
Jonathan: Will? Will!
Joyce: Will? Will! Where are you?
[burger sizzling on the grill]
Benny: Geez. Your parents forget to feed you? Is that why you ran away? They, uh... They hurt you? You went to the hospital, you got scared, you ran off, you wound up here, is that it? All right. I'll give this back, all right? And you can have as much as you want. All right? Maybe even some ice cream. But you gotta answer a few of my questions first, all right? We got a deal? All right, let's start with the easy stuff. All right? my name's Benny. Benny Hammond. See? Like this. Here. I got you. Don't worry. It's okay. Nice to meet you, yeah. And you are?
[sighing]
[sighs]
Benny: Eleven? What's that mean? What's it mean?
Eleven: No.
Benny: Well, I'll be damned. She speaks. "No"? No, what? (clicks tongue) All right, I guess no more food, then.
Eleven: Eleven.
Benny: Yeah. What's it mean?
Eleven: Eleven.
Benny: All right, then. (chuckles) Here you go. Take it easy, take it easy.
[sighs]
Benny: Yeah, look, all I know is that she's scared to death. Yeah, I think maybe she's been abused or... kidnapped or something. Yeah, it'd be great if someone would come by. Yeah, We're at 4819 Randolph Lane. Yeah, Randolph.

Callahan: Will Byers?
[hooting]
Callahan: Come on, kid!
Powell: Will?
[Powell whistles]
Hopper: Hey! I got something.
Callahan: That his bike?
Hopper: Yeah, he must have crashed.
Callahan: You think he got hurt in the fall?
Hopper: Not so hurt he couldn't walk away. Bike like this is like a Cadillac to these kids. He would've walked it home.

Woman #1: ...get off work if I win.
Woman #2: Oh, Friday I'm supposed to...
Woman #3: ... but we will cover whatever the damages are to your property. It's just, um...

[overlapping conversations]
[line ringing]
Joyce: (over the phone) Is Lonnie there?
Cynthia: (over the phone) Lonnie isn't here right now.
Joyce: (over the phone) Can you please--
Cynthia: (over the phone) I told you, Lonnie's not here.
Joyce: Who is this?
Cynthia: (over the phone) His girlfriend, Cynthia.
Joyce: Cynthia.
Cynthia: (over the phone) Who the hell is this?
Joyce: Cynthia, this is Joyce.
Cynthia: (over the phone) Who?
Joyce: Lonnie's ex-wife. I really need to speak to him--
Cynthia: (over the phone) Lonnie's not here.
Joyce: Can you please put-- No!
Cynthia: (over the phone) Why don't you call back later?
Joyce: No, not later. Now! Can--
[line disconnects]
Joyce: Bitch!
Jonathan: Mom.
Joyce: What?
Jonathan: You have to stay calm.
[chuckles]
[Joyce muttering]
[phone ringing]
Lonnie: Hey, you've reached Lonnie. Leave a message and I'll holler right back at ya.
Joyce: Lonnie, some teenager just hung up on me. Will is... Is missing. I don't know where he is. (voice breaking) I need... I just need you to call me back, please, just--
[answering machine beeps]

Joyce: Damn it! Damn it!
[car approaching]
[sighs deeply]
Jonathan: Mom?
Joyce: What?
Jonathan: Cops.
Joyce: It was just lying there?
Hopper: Yeah. Cal?
Joyce: Did it have any blood on it, or--
Hopper: No, no, no, no, no... Phil?
Jonathan: If you found the bike out there, why are you here?
Hopper: Well, he had a key to the house, right?
Jonathan: Yeah.
Hopper: So... maybe he came home.
Joyce: (stammers) You think I didn't check my own house?
Hopper: I'm not saying that. Has this always been here?
Joyce: What? I don't know. Probably. I mean, I have two boys. Look at this place.
Hopper: You're not sure?
[Joyce sighs]
[dog barking]
[barks]
Hopper: Hey. Hey, what's up with this guy, huh?
Joyce: Nothing, he's probably just hungry. Come on.
[indistinct squelching]
[squelching stops]
Callahan: Hey!
Hopper: Jesus!
Callahan: What are you, deaf? I've been calling you.
[exhales]
Callahan: What's going on? Hello? Are you sure you're okay, Chief?
Hopper: Listen, I want you to call Flo. I want to get a search party together, all right? All the volunteers she can muster. Bring flashlights, too.
Callahan: Hey, you think we got a problem here?
Mike: We should be out there right now. We should be helping look for him.
Karen: We've been over this, Mike. he chief says--
Mike: I don't care what the chief said.
Karen: Michael!
Mike: We have to do something. Will can be in danger.
Karen: More reason to stay put.
Mike: Mom!
Karen: End of discussion.
Nancy: So... me and Barbara are gonna study at her house tonight. That's cool, right?
Karen: No, not cool.
Nancy: What? Why not?
Karen: Why do you think? Am I speaking Chinese in this house? Until we know WIll is okay, no one leaves.
Nancy: This is such bullshit.
Ted: Language.
Nancy: So we're under house arrest? Just because Mike's friend got lost on the way home from...
Mike: Wait, this is Will's fault?
Karen: Nancy, take that back.
Nancy: No!
Mike: You're just pissed off 'cause you wanna hang out with Steve.
Ted: Steve?
Karen: Who is Steve?
Mike: Her new boyfriend.
Nancy: You are such a douchebag, Mike!
Ted: Language!
[groans]
Karen: Nancy, come back. Come back! (sighs) It's okay. It's okay, Holly. Here, have some juice, okay?
Ted: You see, Michael? You see what happens?
Mike: (shouts) What happens when what? I'm the only one acting normal here! I'm the only one that cares about Will!
Ted: That is totally unfair, son. We care.
[sighs]
Karen: Mike!
Ted: Let him go.
Karen: I hope you're enjoying your chicken, Ted.
Ted: What did I do? Hey! What'd I do?
Boy: Will!
Man #1: Will Byers!
Man #2: Will!
Woman: Will, we're here for you, bud!
[volunteers shouting indistinctly]
Mr. Clarke: He's a good student.
Hopper: What?
Mr. Clarke: Will. He's a good student. Great one, actually. I don't think we've met. Scott Clarke. Teacher, Hawkins Middle. Earth and biology.
Hopper: I always had a distaste for science.
Mr. Clarke: Well, maybe you had a bad teacher.
Hopper: Yeah, Ms. Ratliff was a piece of work.
Mr. Clarke: (chuckles) Ratliff? You bet. She's still kicking around, believe it or not.
Hopper: Oh, I believe it. Mummies never die, so they tell me. Sara, my daughter... Galaxies, the universe, whatnot... She always understood all that stuff. I always figured there was enough going on down here, I never needed to look elsewhere.
Mr. Clarke: Your daughter, what grade is she? Maybe I'll get her in my class.
Hopper: No, she, uh... She lives with her mom in the city. Thanks for coming out, Teach. We really appreciate it.
Woman: She died a few years back.
Mr. Clarke: Sorry?
Woman: His kid.
Mike: Lucas, do you copy? It's Mike. Lucas?
Lucas: Hey, it's Lucas.
Mike: I know it's you. And say "over" when you're done talking so I know when you're done. Over.
Lucas: I'm done. Over.
Mike: I'm worried about Will. Over.
Lucas: (sighs) Yeah. This is crazy. Over.
Mike: I was thinking... Will could've cast Protection last night, but he didn't. He cast Fireball. Over.
Lucas: What's your point? Over.
Mike: My point is... he could've played it safe, but he didn't. He put himself in danger to help the party. Over.
Lucas: Meet me in ten. Over and out.
[pop music playing on radio]
[tapping on window]
Nancy: (whispers) What are you doing here? I told you on the phone, I'm under house arrest now.
Steve: I figured we'd just study here.
Nancy: No. No way.
Steve: Oh, come on. I can't have you failing this test. So just... bear with me.
[window rattles]
Steve: What'd I tell you? Ninja.

Benny: You like that ice cream, huh? Smile looks good on you. You know, smile?

Benny: All right. You just sit tight. Whoever it is, I'll tell 'em to go away real quick, all right?
[knocking continues]
Benny: Yeah, yeah, yeah... Hey, how can I help you?
Frazier: Hi, You must be Benny Hammond.

Steve: Wow. Jesus, how many of these did you make?
Nancy: You said you wanted to help.
Steve: How about this? How about... How about every time that you get something right, I have to take off an item of clothing. But every time you get something wrong--
