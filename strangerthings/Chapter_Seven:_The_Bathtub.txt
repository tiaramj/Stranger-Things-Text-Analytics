Script: 
[Eleven looks at herself in the mirror]
[she touches her hair]
Mike: You don't need it.
Eleven: Still pretty?
Mike: Yeah! Pretty. Really pretty. El?
Eleven: Yes?
Mike: Um, I'm happy you're home.
Mike: Me, too.
[Mike moves closer to Eleven]
[bathroom door opens]
Dustin: Guys! It's Lucas, I think he's in trouble.
[they leave the bathroom and run to the radio]
Dustin: Do you remember how he said he was looking for the gate?
Mike: Yeah.
Dustin: What if he found it?
[Lucas shouting indistinctly on radio]
Mike: What's he saying?
Dustin: I don't know, he's way out of range.
Lucas: ...son of a bitch!
Mike: Lucas, if you can hear us, slow down. We can't understand you.
[cuts to Lucas biking as fast as he can to the Wheeler House]
Lucas: Yes, I copy! They know about Eleven! Get out of there! They know about Eleven! The bad men are coming! All of them! Do you hear me? The bad men are coming!
Dustin: "Mad hen." Does that mean anything to you? Like a code name or something?
Lucas: The bad men are coming!
Mike: "Bad men." Bad men!
[radio static]
[Mike gasps]
Mike: Stay here.
[Mike and Dustin run upstairs and look out the window to see the Hawkins Power van]
Mike: What's that guy doing?
Dustin: You don't think...
[Mike runs to Karen who's on the phone]
Karen: Well, I know she and Steve have been spending some time together, so I thought maybe-
Mike: Mom!
Karen: Well, is he home? Maybe you could ask him?
Mike: Mom!
Karen: I'm sorry, can you just hold on, please? Michael, I'm on the phone. I've told you a million times-
Mike: Did you schedule any repairs?
Karen: What?
Mike: Is there anyone supposed to come and do repairs on the house?
[Dustin sees more vans arriving and parking outside]
Karen: I don't understand. Is there something wrong-
Mike: No, Mom, nothing's wrong in the house.
Dustin: Mike! 
Mike: One second.
Dustin: Mike! We need to leave... right now.
[Dustin and Mike run to get Eleven]
Karen: Michael!
Mike: If anyone asks where I am, I've left the country.
Karen: What?
[Mike, Dustin and Eleven run outside and grab the bikes]
[they start running and get on as they see Dr. Brenner and agents walking over to them]
[Mike and Dustin start pedalling, the agents getting back in the vans]
[engines starting]
[tires screeching]
Dustin: Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
[Lucas is heard on the radio]
Lucas: Dustin! Dustin, do you copy?
Dustin: Yeah, Lucas, they're on us.
Lucas: Where are you?
Dustin: Cornwallis.
Lucas: Meet me at Elm and Cherry!
Dustin: Copy. Elm and Cherry!
Mike: Okay.
[the vans appear behind them]
Dustin: Shit!
Mike: This way, come on!
[indistinct singing]
[bicycle bell ringing]
Dustin: Out of the way! Out of the way!
[ringing continues]
[Dustin and Mike bike past girls in the playground]
[Mike and Dustin meet with Lucas on Elm and Cherry]
Mike: Lucas! 
Lucas: Where are they?
Mike: I don't know.
Dustin: I think we lost them.
[tires screeching]
Mike: Go, go, go, go, go!
[Dustin yelling]
Mike: Go, go, go, go, go! Faster, faster!
Dustin: Shit, shit, shit, shit, shit!
[Dustin yelling]
[a van appears in front of them]
[Eleven uses her powers to rocket the van over them and crash behind them]
[tires screeching]
[the kids arrive and stop their bikes near the bus]
Dustin: Holy... holy shit! Did... did you see what she did to that van?
Mike: No, Dustin, we missed it.
Dustin: I mean that was...
Lucas: Awesome. It was awesome. 
[Lucas goes over to Eleven who's sat on the floor and kneels beside her]
Lucas: Everything I said about you being a traitor and stuff... I was wrong. I'm sorry.
Eleven: Friends... friends don't lie. I'm sorry, too.
Mike: Me, too.
[Mike offers his hand to Lucas]
[Lucas gets up and shakes his hand]
[Hopper and Joyce arrive at the police station and head inside quickly]
Joyce: Hey. Jonathan? Jesus, what... what happened?
Callahan: Ma'am...
Jonathan: I'm fine.
Joyce: Why is he wearing handcuffs?
Callahan: Well, your boy assaulted a police officer. That's why.
Joyce: Take them off.
Callahan: I am afraid I cannot do that.
Joyce: Take them off!
Hopper: You heard her. Take 'em off.
Powell: Chief, I get everyone's emotional here, but there's something you need to see.
[Powell and Callahan show Hopper the traps and tools in Jonathan's car]
[Hopper puts the box on the desk where Jonathan's chained]
Joyce: What is this?
Hopper: Why don't you ask your son? We found it in his car.
Joyce: What?
Jonathan: Why are you going through my car?
Hopper: Is that really the question you should be asking right now? I wanna see you in my office.
Jonathan: You won't believe me.
Hopper: Why don't you give me a try?
[Karen heads into the basement]
Karen: Mike? Mike?
[she sighs when she can't find him]
[she finds the den and looks around it]
[doorbell rings]
Ted: Yeah, just a minute, please!  Jiminy Christmas.
[doorbell continues ringing]
Ted: Hold your horses.
[Ted opens the door]
Connie Frazier: Mr. Wheeler?
Ted: Yes?
[Karens walks over as Connie shows her badge]
[cuts to agents searching the house]
[Brenner checks the basement with the agents and finds a Benny's shirt in the washing basket]
[men speaking indistinctly]
[cuts to the living room]
Karen: I don't understand. You think my son is hiding this girl?
Ted: What happened to her hair?
Connie Frazier: We just need to know if you've seen her in the past week.
Karen: No, no.
Ted: Absolutely not. Our son with a girl? I mean, believe me, if he had a girl sleeping in this house, we'd know about it. Wouldn't we?
[Karen sighs]
Karen: This girl... what has she done?
Connie Frazier: I'm afraid I can't answer that.
Ted: Oh, my God, is she Russian?
[Karen stammers]
Karen: You can't treat us like this.
Connie Frazier: I need you to stay calm.
Karen: You come into my house, and you tell me that my son is hiding some girl, and that he's in danger, but you can't tell us why? And you, what, you expect me to remain, what, calm?
[Connie Frazier sighs]
[Dr. Brenner comes and changes seats with her]
Dr. Brenner: I understand how upsetting this is. I wish we could tell you more... but I can tell you that your son, Michael, is in real danger. We want to help him. We will help him. I give you my word. But in order for me to do that... you have to trust me. Will you trust me?
[Karen nods]
Dr. Brenner: Good. Now... do you have any idea where your son might have gone?
Lucas: This is Randolph Road, right here. The fence starts here, and goes all the way around. And this is the lab right here. The gate's gotta be in there somewhere. It's gotta be.
Dustin: Well, who owns Hawkins Lab?
Lucas: The sign says "Department of Energy."
Dustin: Department of Energy? What do you think that means?
Mike: It means government. Military.
Dustin: Then why does it say "Energy"?
Mike: Just trust me, all right? It's military. My dad's told me before.
Lucas: Mike's right. There's soldiers out front.
Dustin: Do they make, like, lightbulbs or something?
Mike: No, weapons... to fight the Russians, and commies and stuff.
Lucas: Weapons.
Dustin: Oh, Jesus, this is bad.
Lucas: Really bad. The place is like a fortress.
Dustin: Well, what do we do?
Mike: I don't know, but we can't go home. We're fugitives now.
[helicopter approaching]
Dustin: Guys? Do you hear that?
[they hide their bikes under the bus quickly] 
Mike: Go, go, go, go!
Dustin: Come on, come on! It's stuck. 
Lucas: Let's go, let's go, let's go!
[they rush into the bus and stay low]
Mike: Hurry up! Hurry, come on!
Lucas: Come on!
Dustin: Go, go, go, go, go, go!
[helicopter whirring]
Lucas: Get down!
[helicopter receding]
Dustin: Mental.
[Joyce hands the picture to Hopper after looking at it]
[Joyce sighs]
Hopper: You say blood draws this thing?
Jonathan: We don't know. 
Nancy: It's just a theory.
[Joyce talks with Jonathan outside the office]
Jonathan: I'm sorry, Mom.
Joyce: What, you're sorry? You're... you're sorry? That is not good enough, Jonathan.
Jonathan: I know.
Joyce: That's not even close. That's not even in the... in the ballpark. 
Jonathan: I wanted to tell you, I just-
Joyce: What if this thing took you, too? You risked your life... and Nancy's.
Jonathan: I thought I could save Will... I still do.
Joyce: This is not yours to fix alone. You act like you're all alone out there in the world, but you're not. You're not alone.
Jonathan: I know.
Joyce: God damn it, Jonathan.
Jonathan: I know.
Joyce: Damn it
[Joyce and Jonathan hug]
Troy's mom: I want an apology!
Callahan: An apology for what, exactly?
Troy's mom: Where is the chief? I want to speak to him right this instant.
[Hopper exits his office and looks at Joyce and Jonathan]
Hopper: Stay here.
Callahan: Ma'am, I need you to calm down.
Troy's mom: What is your name, Deputy?
Callahan: Well, I'm an officer... okay?
Troy's mom: Name and badge number, both of you!
[Hopper walks over]
Hopper: What the hell is going on here?
Powell] Chief...
Troy's mom: These men are humiliating my son.
Callahan: No, no, no. Okay, that's not true.
Troy's mom: Yes.
Powell: There was some kind of fight, Chief-
Troy's mom: A psychotic child broke his arm!
Callahan: A little girl, Chief. A little one.
Troy's mom: That tone! Do you hear that tone?
Callahan: Honestly, I'm just trying to state a fact.
Hopper: I don't have time for this.
Callahan: It was a little girl-
Hopper: Will you please take a statement... (mouthing) and get her out?
[Hopper goes to leave]
Callahan: Yes. So what'd this girl look like?
Troy: She had no hair and she was bleeding from her nose. Like a freak.
[Hopper goes up to Troy]
Hopper: What'd you just say?
Troy: I said she's a freak!
Hopper: No, her hair. What'd you say about her hair?
Troy: Her head's shaved. She doesn't even look like a girl. And...
Hopper: And what?
Troy's mom: Tell the man, Troy.
Troy: She can... do things.
Hopper: What kind of things?
Troy: Like... make you fly. And piss yourself.
Hopper: What? Was she alone?
Troy: She always hangs out with those losers.
Hopper: "Losers" What losers?
[a beat-up Steve is sat on a car outside the Fair Mart]
Tommy: Hey. You owe me $1.20.
[Tommy passes him aspirin and a can of Coke]
Tommy: Don't worry, he'll need more than aspirin when we're done with him.
Carol: Yeah, if the creep ever gets out. The cops should just lock him up forever. Did you see the look on his face?
[Steve groans]
Carol: Oh.
[Carol pretends to beat Tommy while pulling a face]
[Tommy chuckles]
Tommy: He probably had that same look whenever he killed his brother, right?
Carol: Oh, God, I just got an image of him making that face while he and Nancy are screwing.
[Tommy chuckles]
Steve: Carol, for once in your life, shut your damn mouth!
Carol: What?
Tommy: Hey, what's your problem, man?
Steve: You're both assholes. That's my problem.
Tommy: Are you serious right now, man?
Steve: Yeah, I'm serious. You shouldn't have done that.
Tommy: Done what?
Steve: You know what.
Tommy: You mean call her out for what she really is? Oh, that's funny, because I don't remember you asking me to stop.
Steve: I should've put that spray paint right down your throat.
Carol: What the hell, Steve?
Steve: You know, neither of you ever cared about her. You never even liked her, because she's not miserable like you two. She actually cares about other people.
Carol: The slut with a heart of gold.
Steve: I told you to watch your mouth!
Tommy: Hey! I don't know what's gotten into you, man, but you don't talk to her that way.
Steve: Get out of my face.
Tommy: Or what? 
[Tommy pins Steve up against the car]
Tommy: Or what? You gonna fight me now, too? Huh? You gonna fight me now, too? Because you couldn't take Jonathan Byers... so I wouldn't recommend that.
[car door opens]
Tommy: Here, let me get the door for you, buddy.
[door slams]
[tires screeching]
Tommy: That's right, Harrington, run away Run away!
[Hopper watches with binoculars as agents clear out the basement]
Nancy: I have to go home.
Hopper: No, you can't. My mom... my dad are there.
[Nancy goes to walk to her house]
[Hopper grabs her arm]
Hopper: They're gonna be okay. Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.
Nancy: Let go. Let go!
Hopper: Hey! Listen to me. Listen to me. The last thing in the world we need is them knowing you're mixed up in all this. 
Nancy: Mike is over there-
Hopper: They haven't found him. Not yet, at least.
[Hopper points out the helicopter]
[helicopter whirring]
Nancy: For Mike?
Hopper: Come on, get in the car. Look, we need to find them before they do. Do you have any idea where he might have gone?
Nancy: No, I don't.
Hopper: I need you to think.
Nancy: I don't know. We haven't talked a lot. I mean, lately... 
Joyce: Is there any place that your... your parents don't know about that he might go?
Nancy: I don't know.
Jonathan: I might.
Hopper: What?
Jonathan: I don't know where he is, but I think I know how to ask him.
[Hopper; Joyce, Jonathan and Nancy run inside]
[Nancy spots the lights]
Nancy: Whoa.
[Jonathan leads them to Will's room]
[he grabs the radio]
Jonathan: I got it.
[helicopter hovering]
[Nancy is heard on the radio]
Nancy: Mike, are you there? Mike?
Dustin: You guys hear that?
Nancy: Mike, it's me, Nancy. Mike, are you there? Answer. Mike, we need you to answer.
Lucas: Is that your sister?
Nancy: This is an emergency, Mike. Do you copy? Mike, do you copy?
Dustin: Okay, this is really weird.
[Lucas goes to grab the radio]
Mike: Don't answer.
Lucas: She said it was an emergency.
Mike: What if it's a trick?
Lucas: It's your sister!
Mike: What if the bad people kidnapped her? What if they're forcing her to say this?
Nancy: I need you to answer.
Dustin: It's like Lando Calrissian. Don't answer.
Nancy: We need to know that you're there, Mike.
Hopper: Listen, kid, this is the chief. If you're there, pick up. We know you're in trouble and we know about the girl.
Lucas: Why is she with the chief? 
Dustin: How the hell does he know about...
Hopper: We can protect you, we can help you, but you gotta pick up. Are you there? Do you copy? Over. 
[Hopper puts down the radio and looks at the others in the Byers house]
Hopper: Anybody got any other ideas?
Mike: Yeah, I copy. It's Mike. I'm here. We're here.
[a man cleans off the graffiti on the sign]
Steve: Need a hand?
Man: Did you have something to do with this?
Steve: I just... I wanna help.
[the man climbs off the ladder]
Man: All yours.
Karen:  They expect us to just sit here like prisoners. We should be out there looking for him.
Ted: Honey, we have to trust them, okay? This is our government. They're on our side.
[Karen sighs]
Ted: Nancy with Mike? No. No.
[Dustin breathing heavily]
Mike: Will you stop pacing?
Dustin: It's been way too long. Do you know what? Maybe you're right. Maybe this is all a trap and the bad men are coming to get us right now!
Lucas: It's not a trap. Why would the chief set us up? Nancy, maybe, but the chief?
Dustin: Lando Calrissian.
Lucas: Would you shut up about Lando?
Dustin: I don't feel good about this. I don't feel good about this!
Lucas: When do you feel good about anything?
[vehicles approaching]
Dustin: Shit!
Mike: Go, go, go, go.
[they all run and hide behind the seats]
Dustin: Lando.
Lucas: You think they saw us?
Mike: Both of you, shut up.
[the agents get out of their cars and look around]
[one spots the bikes under the bus]
[he opens the bus door and gets knocked out]
Agent: Hey!
[Agent grunts]
Agent 2: What the-
[grunting]
[door creaks]
[Hopper walks into the bus]
Hopper: All right, let's go. Let's go!
[Nancy, Mike and Joyce are sat on the sofa]
[they see lights and run outside]
Nancy: Mike. Oh, my God. Mike! 
[Nancy runs over and hugs him]
Nancy: I was so worried about you.
Mike: Yeah, uh... me, too.
Nancy: Is that my dress?
Mike: Okay, so, in this example, we're the acrobat. Will and Barbara, and that monster, they're this flea. And this is the Upside Down, where Will is hiding. Mr. Clarke said the only way to get there is through a rip of time and space.
Dustin: A gate.
Lucas: That we tracked to Hawkins Lab. 
Dustin: With our compasses.
[the adults look confused]
Dustin: Okay, so the gate has a really strong electromagnetic field and that can change the directions of a compass needle.
Hopper: Is this gate underground?
Eleven: Yes.
Hopper: Near a large water tank?
Eleven: Yes.
Dustin: How do you know all that?
Mike: He's seen it.
Joyce: Is there any way that you could... that you could reach Will? That you could talk to him in this-
Eleven: The Upside Down.
Joyce: Down. Yeah.
Nancy: And my friend Barbara? Can you find her, too?
[cuts to Eleven sat at a table with a picture of Barb and the radio]
[static]
[static increases]
[static becomes faint]
Eleven: I'm sorry.
Joyce: What? What's wrong? What happened?
Eleven: I can't find them.
[Eleven goes to the bathroom and runs the faucet]
[she wipes her face]
[turns faucet off]
Mike: Whenever she uses her powers, she gets weak. 
Dustin: The more energy she uses, the more tired she gets.
Lucas: Like, she flipped the van earlier.
Dustin: It was awesome.
Mike: But she's drained.
Jonathan: Like a bad battery.
Joyce: Well... How do we make her better?
Mike: We don't. We just have to wait and try again.
Nancy: Well, how long?
Mike: I don't know.
Eleven: The bath.
Joyce: What?
Eleven: I can find them. In the bath.
[screaming on TV]
Jen: Oh! Oh. Oh, my... No, mmm-mmm.
Mr. Clarke: Hey, you know how they did that? You know what that is?
Jen: No, what?
Mr. Clarke: Melted plastic and microwaved bubble gum.
Jen: No way. Really?
Mr. Clarke: Really.
[phone ringing]
Mr. Clarke: What in the world?
Jen: Do you want me to pause it?
Mr. Clarke: I'm sure it's just a wrong number.
[he answers the phone]
Mr. Clarke: Hello?
Dustin: Mr. Clarke? It's Dustin.
Mr. Clarke: Dustin? Is everything okay?
Dustin: Yeah, yeah. I just, I... I have a science question.
Mr. Clarke: It's ten o'clock on Saturday. Why don't we pick this up-
Dustin: Do you know anything about sensory deprivation tanks? Specifically how to build one?
Mr. Clarke: Sensory deprivation? What is this for?
Dustin: Fun.
Mr. Clarke: Okay. Well... Why don't we talk about it Monday? After school, okay?
Dustin: You always say we should never stop being curious. To always open any curiosity door we find.
Mr. Clarke: Dustin-
Dustin: Why are you keeping this curiosity door locked?
Dustin: Uh-huh.
[indistinct chatter over phone]
Dustin: Uh-huh. How much? Uh-huh. Yep, all right. Yeah, we'll be careful. Definitely. All right, Mr. Clarke. Yeah, I'll see you on Monday. I'll see you on Monday, Mr. Clarke. Bye. Do you still have that kiddie pool we bobbed for apples in?
Joyce: I think so. Yeah. Yeah.
Dustin: Good. Then we just need salt. Lots of it.
Hopper: How much is "lots"?
Dustin: 1,500 pounds.
Nancy: Well, where are we gonna get that much salt?
[Hopper and Joyce park outside]
[Hopper and Jonathan grab some de-icing salt]
Jonathan: Hey, wait. It's not gonna snow next week, is it?
Hopper: Worst case, no school.
Jonathan: Even if we find Will in there... what are we gonna do about that thing?
Hopper: We're not gonna do anything. I don't want you anywhere near this, all right? Your mom's been through enough already.
Jonathan: He's my brother.
Hopper: Listen to me. I'm gonna find him. All right? You gotta trust me on this. I am going to find him.
[Dustin wheels the pool into the gym]
Dustin: This damn thing is heavy. 
[he and Lucas set it up]
Dustin: Come on. It's upside down.
Lucas: No, this way.
Dustin: Okay, um... How does this even work?
Lucas: Try that side.
Dustin: Son of a bitch!
Lucas: Pull it back. Pull it back.
Dustin: I am!
Lucas: One, two, three.
Dustin: Shit!
[outside, Nancy and Mike try to get into the shed]
[Nancy tries the door but it's locked]
[Mike tries to bash the door but hurts his arm]
Mike: Ah...
Nancy: Stand back.
Mike: Huh?
[Nancy breaks the lock with a rock]
[Nancy opens the door and goes in]
Mike: Whoa.
[Nancy grabs the hoses and puts them in a wheelbarrow]
[they wheel the hoses back to the gym]
Nancy: What did she even eat?
Mike: What?
Nancy: Eleven.
Mike: Oh. Candy, leftovers, Eggos... She really likes Eggos.
Nancy: I knew you were acting weird. I just... I thought it was because of Will.
Mike; I knew you were acting weird, too. I thought it was 'cause of Steve.
Nancy: Hey... No more secrets, okay? From now on we tell each other everything.
Mike: Okay. Do you like Jonathan now?
Nancy: What? No. No, it's... it's not... it's not like that. Do you like Eleven?
Mike: What? No. Ew. Gross.
[Joyce tapes up some safety goggles]
[she sits with Eleven]
Joyce: This will keep it dark for you. Just like in your bathtub. You're a very brave girl. You know that, don't you? Everything you're doing for my boy... for Will... for my family... Thank you.
[she holds Eleven's hands]
Joyce: Listen. I am gonna be there with you the whole time. And if it ever gets too scary... in that place, you just let me know, okay?
Eleven: Yes. 
Joyce: Ready?
Eleven: Ready.
[Nancy and Mike set up the hoses and attach them to the faucets]
[Lucas keeps track of the temperature]
Lucas: Colder! Warmer! Right there!
[Hopper and Jonathan empty the salt into the pool]
[Dustin tests it with an egg]
[it sinks]
[Hopper and Jonathan add more salt]
[Dustin puts an egg in the water]
[it floats]
[Mike puts the radio on a table nearby]
[static]
[Eleven takes off her socks and the watch]
[she puts on the taped goggles and gets into the pool]
[electricity surging]
[Eleven breathes heavily]
[she looks around]
Eleven: Barb? Barbara?
[Eleven breathes heavily]
[she walks over to something]
[she sees that it's Barb covered in goo with something coming out of her mouth]
[electricity surges]
Nancy: What's going on?
Mike: I don't know.
Nancy: Is Barb okay? Is she okay?
Eleven: Gone! Gone! Gone! Gone! Gone! Gone. Gone.
[Nancy crying]
Eleven: Gone.
Joyce:  It's okay. It's okay. It's okay.
Eleven: Gone. Gone!
Joyce: It's okay. It's okay.
Eleven: Gone!
Joyce: Hey. It's okay. It's okay, we're right here. We're right here, honey. It's okay. I got you. Don't be afraid. I'm right here with you. I'm right here with you. It's okay. It's okay. It's okay. It's okay, you're safe. You're okay, honey.
[Eleven sees Castle Byers, Barb has disappeared]
Eleven: Castle Byers. Castle Byers. 
[Eleven opens the fort and goes inside]
Eleven: Will. Will?
[Joyce gasps]
Joyce: You tell him... tell him I'm coming. Mom is coming.
Eleven: Your mom... she's coming for you.
Will: Hurry.
[Will's voice is heard on the radio]
Will: Hurry.
Joyce: Okay. Listen, you tell him to... to stay where he is. We're coming. We're coming, okay? We're coming, honey. 
Eleven: Just... just hold on a little longer. Will. Will.
[low growling]
[things start disappearing in Castle Byers]
Eleven: Will? Will!
[whimpering on radio]
[Dustin and Mike gasp as Eleven wakes up]
Joyce: Oh!
[Eleven breathing heavily]
Joyce pulls her into a hug]
Joyce: Oh, okay, okay. I've got you. It's okay. I got you. I got you. I got you, honey. You did so good. Are you okay?
[Eleven cries]
[they give Eleven a towel and make her sit down]
[she leans against Mike and Lucas makes sure she's covered]
Hopper: So this fort. Where is it?
Joyce:  Uh, it's in the woods behind our house.
Jonathan: Yeah, he used to go there to hide.
[Hopper leaves, followed by Joyce and Jonathan]
Hopper: Hey, get back inside.
Joyce: What, are you insane? No, I'm-
Hopper: Look, if something happens to me, I don't make it back-
Joyce: Yeah, but then I'll go. You stay.
Hopper: Are you kidding me?
Joyce: He's my son, Hop. My son. I'm going! Now, listen, I need you to stay here...
Jonathan: No.
Joyce: ...and watch over the kids.
Jonathan: No, Mom.
Jonathan: I can help.
Joyce: Please, I need you to stay, Jonathan.
Hopper: Joyce!
Joyce: Please.
[Joyce hugs Jonathan]
Jonathan: Please, be careful.
[Hopper gets into his truck]
Hopper: Joyce, come on!
Joyce: Please. I'm gonna find him. I'm gonna find him.
[Joyce gets in the truck]
[engine starting]
[tires screeching]
[door opens as Jonathan heads back inside]
[Nancy is sat on the floor, alone]
Nancy: We have to go back to the station.
Jonathan: What?
Nancy: Your mom and Hopper are just walking in there like bait. That thing is still in there. And we can't just sit here and let it get them, too. We can't.
Jonathan: You still wanna try it out?
Nancy: I wanna finish what we started. I want to kill it.
[Hopper parks outside the fence]
[they get out, Hopper with bolt cutters]
Joyce: So this is your plan?
Hopper: Worked for me before, didn't it? 
Joyce: Well, did it? 
Hopper: Come on, trust me.
[announcer on radio is heard as Jonathan and Nancy sneak through the station]
Announcer: I'd like to hear your thoughts on the war. I think we're dealing with a whole different environment here.
Announcer 2: I'll tell you what, we always planned on the Russians massing the fire and we...
[Jonathan sneaks into Hopper's office and grabs the box]
[Hopper and Joyce make their way across the grass]
[a floodlight turns on]
