Script: 
[tires screech as Joyce drives to the mall]
[ominous synth music playing]
[radio static crackling]
Joyce: Still nothing?
Murray: Nothing.
Hopper: Food court? You sure they said food court?
Murray: I'm sorry, have my translation skills been letting you down? We don't know it's your kids.
Joyce: Yes, we do.
[Joyce turns, tires screeching]
[engine revving]
[screaming and sobbing]
[Eleven wails in pain]
[flesh sizzling]
Erica: What is that?
Mike: There's something in there.
Eleven: No!
Dustin: Jesus Christ.
Jonathan: Keep her talking. Keep her awake, okay?
[he runs off to find something]
Dustin: Jesus Christ.
[Jonathan grunts, jumping over the counter of Imperial Panda]
[he looks through the drawers, panting]
[he exhales sharply as he finds gloves, and heats up a knife to sterilize it]
Mike; Hey, hey, hey. Stay awake, stay awake. Let's get her on this side, on this side. Easy, easy, easy, easy.
[they carefully move her so she's sat up slightly]
Robin: [trying to play it calm and calm down Eleven It's, uh... You know, it's not actually that bad. There was a... The goalie on my soccer team, Beth Wildfire, this other girl slid into her leg, and the bone came out of her knee, six inches or something, it was insane.
Steve: Robin.
Robin: Yeah?
Steve: You're not helping.
Robin: I'm sorry.
[running footsteps as Jonathan runs back over with the knife and gloves]
Jonathan: Okay. All right, El? This is gonna hurt like hell, okay?
Eleven: [sobs] Okay.
Jonathan: [puts on gloves] Need you to stay real still. Here, you're gonna want to bite down on this, okay? [passes a wooden spoon]
Dustin: Jesus Christ.
[Eleven whimpers, putting the spoon in her mouth]
Dustin: Holy shit. Holy shit.
[Jonathan readies the knife]
Mike: Do it.
Jonathan: Okay.
[Dustin murmurs uncomfortably]
[Eleven screams as the knife goes in her leg]
[screaming continues]
[Nancy exclaims]
Dustin: Oh, shit.
[Jonathan, determined not to puke into the wound, finishes the incision]
[Eleven screams, sobs]
[Eleven screeches in pain as Jonathan puts his fingers into the cut]
[Mike exclaims]
[Eleven whimpers and screams]
Nancy: Jonathan!
Jonathan: Stop talking!
[Eleven screams as his fingers move, trying to catch the moving thing]
Jonathan: Goddamn it!
Eleven: [spits out the spoon] No! Stop it! Stop! Stop!
[Jonathan pulls away when Nancy puts a hand on him]
Eleven: [grunts] I can do it. I can do it.
[Eleven sits up properly, crying and panting]
[low frequency vibration]
[she starts using her powers on the thing]
[Eleven wails]
Eleven: God!
[vibrations intensify]
Eleven: God!
[creature chittering, close to the surface]
[Eleven wails]
[screaming]
[screaming continues, Eleven accidentally breaking the nearby shop window]
[Max yelps as the glass breaks and falls]
[Eleven's screaming continues]
[creature shrieks as it is finally removed]
[Eleven's scream continues as she throws it away from her]
[she grunts]
[creature chitters painfully]
[it starts crawling away, screeching]
[a heavy boot comes down on it... is it Grigori?] 
[intense synth music playing]
[the kids look over at the people that have arrived in Starcourt]
[Joyce, Hopper and Murray have entered the chat]
[they clean up Eleven's wound and all sit down around the fountain]
Mike: The Mind Flayer, it built this monster in Hawkins, to stop El, to kill her and pave a way into our world.
Nancy: And it almost did. That was just one tiny piece of it.
Hopper: How big is this thing?
Jonathan: It's big. [murmurs] Thirty feet, at least.
Lucas: Yeah. It sorta destroyed your cabin.
[Hopper looks at him, too pissed off and worried about Eleven to really react to Lucas right now]
Lucas: Sorry.
Steve: Okay, so, just to be clear, this... this big fleshy spider thing that hurt El, it's some kind of gigantic... weapon?
Nancy: Yes.
Steve: But instead of, like, screws and metal, the Mind Flayer made its weapon... with melted people.
Nancy: Yes, exactly.
Steve: Yeah, okay. I- Yeah, I'm just making sure.
Joyce: Are we sure this thing is still out there, still alive?
Max: El beat the shit out of it, but, yeah, it's still alive. 
Will: But if we close the gate again-
Max: We cut the brain off from the body.
Lucas: And kill it. Theoretically.
Murray: Yoo-hoo!
[he walks over from wherever he was, papers rustling]
Murray: Yoo-hoo! [puts down the papers] Okay, this is what Alexei called "the hub." Now, the hub takes us to the vault room.
Hopper: Okay, where's the gate?
Murray: Right here. I don't know the scale on this, but I think it's fairly close to the vault room, maybe 50 feet or so.
Erica: More like 500. 
[Murray looks at Erica as if to say 'who left this sassy small child here?']
Erica: What, you're just gonna waltz in there like it's commie Disneyland or something?
[Hopper is very glad Eleven isn't this sassy, just superpowered]
Murray: I'm sorry, who are you?
Erica: Erica Sinclair. Who are you?
Murray: Murray... Bauman.
Murray: I'm sorry, why is this four-year-old speaking to me?
Erica: Um, I'm ten, you bald bastard!
Lucas: Erica!
Erica: Just the facts!
Dustin: She's right. You're all gonna die, but you don't have to. Excuse me. Sorry, may I?
Murray: Please.
Dustin: Okay, see this room here? This is a storage facility. There's a hatch in here that feeds into their underground ventilation system. That will lead you to the base of the weapon. It's a bit of a maze down there, but between me and Erica, we can show you the way.
Hopper: You can show us the way?
Dustin: Don't worry, you can do all the fighting and the dangerous hero shit, and we'll just be your... navigators.
Hopper: No. Nope.
[they prepare and Hopper loots the dead Russians like it's a round of Fortnite]
[cocks assault rifle]
Erica: Well, that settles it. He's gonna die. They're gonna die.
Dustin: Yep, most likely.
Lucas: You guys survived.
Dustin: Barely. We could've really used you guys down there.
Mike: Could've used you up here, too.
Lucas: Yeah, man. We missed you, dude.
Will: Yeah. Big-time.
Dustin: [hugs them] I missed you guys, too. Big-time.
Erica: Please don't cry, nerds.
Lucas: Erica.
Erica: Keep saying my name, see what happens.
Hopper: Hey, heads up. [throws a radio to Dustin] You can navigate, just from someplace safe.
Dustin: It's not that simple.
Erica: The signal won't reach.
Dustin: Not with this. You need something with a high enough frequency band to relay with the Russians' radio tower. But for that to work, you need someone who has both seen their comms room and has access to a super-powered handcrafted radio tower, one preferably already situated at the highest point in Hawkins. Oh, wait. That's me. If you want us to navigate, you got us. But we need a head start. And a car.
[Steve heads outside with Dustin, Robin and Erica]
["Goldrush" by Yello playing]
Steve: Oh, man, now this... this is what I'm talkin' about!
Robin: "Toddfather"?
Steve: Oh, screw Todd! Steve's her daddy now.
Robin: Did you just talk about yourself in the third person?
Erica: Did he just call himself daddy?
[they get in the car]
Steve: All right, where are we going?
Dustin: Weathertop.
Steve: Weather-what?
Dustin: Just drive.
Steve: Okay. Jesus!
[engine revs]
[Steve drives off into the night, tires squealing]
[Murray goes through some keys with Nancy and Jonathan, probably to something in his house]
Murray: Bottom lock, second-to-top lock, third-to-top lock, top lock.
Joyce: Listen to me, I need to end this, but I will be back before you know it, okay?
Will: I don't know, Mom.
Joyce: No, listen. You're gonna be safe there. It's- It's far away from all this. You just stick close to your brother and- and do whatever he says. No matter what. Okay?
Will: I'm not worried about me, Mom, I'm worried about you.
Joyce: Oh, honey, I'm gonna be fine. Okay? I'm gonna be fine.
[Will winces when she hugs him too tight]
Will: Okay, Mom. Okay, Mom. That's enough.
Joyce: I'm gonna be fine.
Will: Okay. Mom, I can't breathe.
[Eleven and Hopper are talking nearby]
[Eleven is wearing Sara's hairband that Hopper usually wears as they hold hands, his thumb still in the hairband to show that he's passing it on
Eleven: My battery's low, but...
Will: You're suffocating me.
Eleven: ...it will recharge.
Hopper: I know it will, kid. I know.
Eleven: I can fight.
Hopper: Better than any of us. But right now, I need you safe. This thing is after you. It's not after me. Do you understand? Hey... I need you to understand. 
[Eleven nods slightly, they both look like they're about to cry]
Hopper: [quietly] Okay?
Mike: Hey. We should probably go.
[Hopper sighs]
[Eleven hugs Hopper and he murmurs as they hold each other]
[Eleven lets go and stands up, helped by Mike and Max, leaving Hopper sat on the fountain alone]
Hopper: Mike? Be careful. [sighs]
[Mike nods and heads off with Jonathan, Will, Nancy, Eleven, Lucas and Max]
[Joyce walks over to Hopper and sighs]
[he looks at her and she looks back at him]
Joyce: What?
Hopper: It's a two-man operation. Two!
Joyce: Yeah, well, change of plans.
[Murray can't believe this is happening again as they walk]
Hopper: Change of plans?
Joyce: Yeah. Will you explain it to him, please?
Murray: We have two options here, Jim. We can turn the machine off, or we can explode it.
Hopper: Oh, yeah, says who?
Murray: Says the man who built it!
Joyce: Yeah, and we wanna explode it!
Murray: Or else our heroic efforts will be for naught! This is a three-man operation, Jim, not two.
Joyce: Yeah, three.
[Hopper grumbles as he goes through the door]
[Eleven grunts in pain as Mike and Max help her walk]
Max: El, you're bleeding.
Mike: Are you okay?
Eleven: Yeah.
Max: Here.
Mike: Okay.
[Max gets the door for Eleven and Mike helps her in]
Mike: Here.
[Eleven groans]
Mike: Lay down.
[Eleven whimpers]
[engine sputters]
Jonathan: What's wrong?
Nancy: I don't... I don't know.
[engine sputtering]
Nancy: You can't be serious. Come on!
Lucas: Didn't your mom just buy this car?
Nancy: Yes. I'm sure it's fine.
Will: Did you leave the lights on?
Nancy: No.
Lucas: Do we have gas?
Nancy: Yes!
[engine sputters]
Nancy: Come on!
Jonathan: [stops her] Whoa, whoa, whoa! Just stop, stop! Pop the hood.
[he gets out]
[hood latch clunks]
[Nancy gets out too]
Jonathan: What the hell?
Nancy: What?
Jonathan: The ignition cable's gone.
[car engine roaring]
[they turn to see who it is]
[a car's lights turn on, the engine revving]
[ominous synth music playing]
[engine revving]
[we see that Billy has entered the chat]
[engine revving]
[Max gasps]
[revving continues]
[Nancy suddenly bangs on the car door window, scaring the crap out of Lucas and Will]
[she opens the doors so the kids can run out]
Nancy: Back in the mall! Back in the mall! Go! Go, go, go!
[Mike and Max carry Eleven inside]
Mike: Be careful!
Nancy: Go! Go!
[revving continues]
Nancy and Jonathan: Go, go, go!
[revving continues]
Murray: So then I yank those cables like I'm pulling weeds.
Hopper: And that'll set off the alarm-
Murray: According to Alexei, may his soul rest in peace. Which should give you two an opening to retrieve the keys from the vault.
Joyce: And then we just follow the map to the observation room, turn the key-
Murray: Kaboom, we blow this sucker sky-high.
Joyce: Yeah. And then, once the rift is closed, we escape back through the vents.
Murray: Right under their commie noses.
Joyce: Then home free.
Hopper: Uh...
Joyce: Oh, God, just because it wasn't your plan doesn't mean it was a bad plan.
Hopper: I didn't say it was a bad plan.
Joyce: You made a noise.
Hopper: I did not make a noise.
Joyce: You did too. I really think it's disrespectful...
Hopper: What is up with you and noises?
Murray: Children! Children! 
[Hopper stands up, he is a lorge boi compared to Joyce and Murray]
Murray: It is a good plan. A solid B, which is laudable, given the situation and time constraints. Dare I say, if it all goes right...
[elevator thuds to a stop]
Murray: ...they'll never even know we were here.
[the elevator door opens and Russian guards point their guns at them]
Guard: [in Russian] Stop right there!
Murray: [in Russian] Don't shoot! Don't shoot! Documents, important documents- for the Lieutenant-Comrade! He called us, last minute. Pardon our sloppy appearance.
Guard: [in Russian] Lieutenant? What Lieutenant?
Murray: Lieutenant... Molotov?
[soldiers murmur in confusion]
[Hopper suddenly pushes Murray out the way and sweeps the assault rifle, shooting all the guards]
[Joyce screams and covers her ears]
[Joyce whimpers]
[Murray panting]
Hopper: [realises he's out of bullets] Oh, shit.
Murray: Jim...
["Higher and Higher" playing]
Murray: This is crazy.
Joyce: Oh, my God.
Murray: Jim, I... This... I had it under control.
Hopper: Yeah, sure you did.
[Hopper grunts and undresses one of the guards]
Joyce: What are you doing?
Hopper; I'm improvising.
♪ Your love, Liftin' me higher... ♪
[Steve is still driving to his disappointment]
Steve: Jesus, how far is this place, man?
Dustin: Relax, we're almost there.
Robin: Suzie must be pretty special, huh? I mean, if you built this thing and lugged it all the way to the middle of nowhere just to talk to her? 
Dustin: I mean, nobody's scientifically perfect, but Suzie's about as close to being perfect as any human could possibly be.
[Robin smiles happily at the thought of young love, Erica however is not having it]
Erica: She sound made-up to me. She sound made-up to you?
[Steve is quiet. Everyone looks at him]
Dustin: Why are you hesitating, Steve?
Steve: I'm- I'm- I'm not! I'm not! I think she sounds real. You know, totally, absolutely real.
Dustin: Left. Turn left.
Steve: There's not a road here.
Dustin: Turn left now!
Steve: Jesus! Hang on!
♪ Higher and higher ♪
[Steve turns the car into a field, breaking the fence]
Steve: Whoa! Henderson, where are we going?!
Dustin: Up!
Steve: Whoa!
♪ Liftin' me higher... ♪
[Steve starts driving up Weathertop]
Steve: Oh, Jesus!
Robin: We're not gonna make it!
Steve: Yes, we are. Come on, baby. Come on, baby!
[car engine straining]
Steve: Come on! [grunts] Come on. Come on. Come on!
Robin: Guess the Toddfather has its limitations.
[Steve panting]
[he gives up and stops the car, the engine stops]
[dramatic synth music playing]
[car doors shutting as they get out and head up the hill]
Mike [on radio] Scoops Troop, do you copy? Scoops Troop, do you copy?
[radio static hissing]
Mike: Scoops Troop, do you copy? Scoops Troop, I repeat, do you copy?
Mike: We're trapped in the mall and in need of emergency transportation.
[Lucas practising with his wrist rocket]
Mike: Scoops Troop, do you copy? Billy has found us. He has disabled our car and we are trapped in the mall. Repeat: Billy has disabled our car and we are trapped in the mall.
[Nancy loots another guard for his gun and checks the magazine]
Mike: Scoops Troop...
[Will and Max watch Nancy]
Max: You're gonna kill him, aren't you?
Nancy: This is just a precaution, okay?
Will: And not just against Billy. If he knows we're here, so does the Mind Flayer.
Mike: Scoops Troop, I repeat, we are in need of emergency transportation. Do you copy?
[radio static hissing]
Mike: Scoops Troop, do you copy?
[they look at the car Eleven threw into the Russians]
Nancy: No chance that thing'll drive, right?
Mike: Steve, do you copy?
Jonathan: We don't need it to drive.
Mike: Dustin!
Jonathan: We just need the ignition cable.
[they go to the car and try to turn it over, all straining]
Jonathan: Push!
[metal squealing]
[straining continues]
[glass shatters as the car falls back down]
Will: Shit!
[it cuts to Will, who wasn't even helping so why did he swear, and Eleven]
Eleven: Let me try.
Mike: [panting] El...
[she limps forwards slightly]
Eleven: [sighs] I can do it.
[Mike sighs and they all move out of the way]
[low frequency vibration]
[metal buckling]
[gasps]
[metal squealing]
[strained breaths from Eleven]
[metal squealing]
[Eleven panting]
[vibration intensifies]
[Eleven yells]
[female voice speaking Russian on PA]
[Murray stops the vehicle, the brakes squealing]
Guard: [in Russian] Can I help?
Murray: [in Russian] Picking up.
Guard: Do I know you?
Murray: New arrivals. Landed last night.
Guard: Say goodbye to sunlight.
Murray: Who needs sunlight when we have one another, comrade?
Guard: [chuckles] Indeed, comrade!
Murray: And a bottle of Stolichnaya.
[both laughing]
[the guard presses a button and opens the door with a loud beep]
[Murray and guard continue laughing]
[Murray chuckles as he drives off]
[loud beeping as the dor closes again]
[they stop and Murray lets Joyce out the back of the car]
Joyce: Why are you talking so much?
Murray: He was nice.
[Murray helps her out of the car while Hopper looks around]
Joyce: He was nice?
Murray: He was a nice guard.
Hopper: Yeah, I mean, we should probably invite him over after all this is done. 
Joyce: Yeah, I can bake him a casserole.
Hopper: Get a six-pack, share some laughs. You know, have a drink.
[Murray seethes as he opens the grate]
Murray: Ugh. Anyone wanna trade jobs?
Dustin: [on radio] Bald Eagle, do you copy?
Dustin: Bald Eagle, I repeat, this is Scoops Troop, do you copy?
Murray: Yes, I copy.
[all the kids chuckle with relief]
Dustin: Call sign?
Murray: [scoffs] Bald Eagle.
Dustin: Please repeat.
Murray: Bald Eagle. This is Bald Eagle!
Dustin: Copy that. Good to hear your voice, Bald Eagle. What's your 20?
Murray: We reached the vent. I'll contact you when I need you. Until then, silence.
Dustin: Roger that, Bald Eagle. This is Scoops Troop, going radio silent. 10-10, over.
Murray: I hate children.
[he starts climbing into the grate]
Murray: [groans] Remember, if anyone says anything, just-
Joyce: Smile and nod. 
Hopper: [sighs] Good luck.
[Murray starts crawling and Hopper covers the grate up again]
[all straining to turn the car over]
Jonathan: Push!
[metal squealing]
[they get the car to stay on its side, grunting and panting]
Jonathan: All right, great. All right, now, all the way. Ready? Three, two, one... Push!
[all straining]
Mike: Told you. Physics.
[they get down and Nancy and Jonathan try to open the hood]
Nancy: How do we get it open?
Jonathan: Uh, there should be a latch. Check under the wheel. You see it?
Nancy: I don't know, hold on.
[Max isn't looking at the car]
Max: What's she doing?
[Mike exhales sharply and turns to look at Eleven]
[Eleven is looking through a trash can]
[she finds a Coke can and puts it down]
[high frequency vibration]
[vibration intensifies as she keeps trying to crush the can]
[Mike and Max walk over]
Mike: [echoing] El.
[vibration stops]
Mike: Are you okay?
[ominous music playing]
[Jonathan grunts as he opens the hood]
Nancy: Do you see it?
Jonathan: I don't know. It should be right here. Distributor, distributor...
[Will feels goosebumps on his neck with the fluttering sound]
[distant rumbling]
[Max looks up and sees a shadow walking across the skylight]
[pounding footsteps]
Max: Mike.
[skylight glass clinking]
[footsteps continue]
[Mike looks up and gasps]
Jonathan: Got it.
Mike: Nancy!
[creature snarling]
[Mike grabs Eleven and runs]
Mike: Come on!
[glass shattering]
[the creature falls through the ceiling, shrieking]
[snarling]
[it 'looks' around slightly, roaring]
[the elevator goes down and opens, revealing Grigori and his gang]
[they see the people that Hopper killed and stupidly left out in the open because he knows not the ways of subtlety]
[dramatic synth music playing]
Guard: [in Russian] We just found them like this.
Grigori: [in Russian] The American.
Hopper: It's taking too long.
Joyce: It's fine.
Hopper: No, it's not. It is not.  She could've died back there. She almost did.
Joyce: Well, she's safe now. She's on her way to Murray's. That thing won't find her, not before we kill it.
Hopper: Hey. This isn't the way this is supposed to work, all right? You're supposed to say, "Yes, I told you so. That's why we needed to go back to the kids."
Joyce: Oh, yeah, and then you say something like... [as Hopper] "Yeah, well, it's really hard to listen when you make everything sound like it's the end of the goddamn world."
[gentle Russian ballad playing]
[she gives him a look and he takes a second to just process what he just heard]
Hopper: You know... I think, despite everything, I mean, despite the arguing, I think we make a pretty good team.
Joyce: [clicks tongue and sits down] Well, we made it this far, didn't we? [sighs]
Hopper: Yeah. We did. We did.
Joyce: So, uh... did I get the job or what? Ah, come on. Detective Byers. It has a ring, doesn't it?
Hopper: It's kinda hard to serve in a town where you don't live, Detective.
[Joyce clicks tongue]
Hopper: You're still moving outta here. I mean, that is the plan, right?
Joyce: [sighs] Eh, we'll see how it goes. 
Hopper: "How it goes"? How what goes?
Joyce: You know, if- if we actually do make it out of here, we- we deserve to celebrate, right?
Hopper: Yeah. I mean... yes. [sits down] Absolutely.
Joyce: I hear Enzo's is pretty good. What do you say, Friday, eight o'clock?
Hopper: Uh, El likes to watch Miami Vice on Fridays. It- It starts at 10:00, so I- I can't be out late on a Friday.
Joyce: Okay, well, how about 7:00, then?
Hopper: 7:00? Enzo's, Friday, I meet you there?
Joyce: No, you pick me up.
Hopper: Picking you up, 7:00 p.m. Friday.
Joyce: Yeah, it's a date.
Hopper: [inhales sharply] Just for clarification, just because I... I mean, just... If... When you say "date," just so that we're crystal clear, so there's no confusion- Yeah?
Joyce: Yeah, Hop? Stop talking or I'm gonna change my mind.
Hopper: Yeah, okay. Yeah. Okay.
[Russian ballad crescendos as they relax slightly, the bloody bullet holes in their disguises kind of ruining the mood but hey, Murray would be proud of the children]
[speaking of Murray, he climbs through the vents and grunts]
[radio beeps]
Murray: [sighs] Scoops Troop, this is... Hm. Bald Eagle.
Murray [on radio] I've reached another junction.
Dustin: This is what?
Erica: The fourth junction.
Dustin: All right, so if memory serves, this is right after the My Little Pony thesis.
Erica: We went left, so he has to go right.
Dustin: Right. Fly right, Bald Eagle.
Dustin: [on radio] Fly right.
Murray: Roger that, flying right. Little shit.
Robin: What's the My Little Pony thesis?
Erica: Don't get him started.
Robin: Get him started? Just tell me-
Steve: Hey, guys?
[they get up and look at what Steve is looking at, ominous synth music playing]
[they look and see Starcourt flashing like what you'd see outside a disco]
[they run to the radio tower]
Dustin: Griswold Family, this is Scoops Troop! Do you copy? Over! Griswold Family, I repeat, this is Scoops Troop. Do you-
[creature shrieks on radio]
Dustin: Griswold Family, do you copy? Do you copy?!
[the creature has somehow figured out how to use the radio after never using one before, roaring]
[it throws the radio and breaks it]
[Lucas, Will, Nancy and Jonathan are hiding behind the car]
Dustin: Griswold Family, this is Scoops Troop. Please confirm your safety! Griswold Family, this is Scoops Troop! Please confirm your safety! Are you en route to Bald Eagle's nest?
[Dustin continues indistinctly]
[creature roaring]
Dustin: Please confirm your safety! Someone, please just answer. Is anyone there?
[Will shudders]
Dustin: Just answer! Anyone, please...
[radio transmission garbles]
[the creature starts moving around, hunting for Eleven but probably wouldn't mind eating one of the others as a snack while he hunts]
[Eleven panting]
[the creature snarling]
[growling]
[the bit that was in Eleven's leg makes a chittering noise as it joins with the creature]
[the creature roars]
[Eleven panting]
Dustin: [distorted transmission] Griswold Family, do you copy? Griswold Family, do you copy? 
Dustin: Griswold Family, do you copy?
[snarling sounds on radio]
Dustin: Do you copy?!
[Steve gets up and runs to the Todfather]
Erica: Where are you going?!
Steve: To get them the hell outta there! Stay here, contact the others!
Robin: Shit.
[she runs after him]
Dustin: Wait, Robin! Stay in touch.
[he gives her a radio]
Robin: Got it.
Dustin: Bald Eagle, this is Scoops Troop. What's your 20?
Murray: I told you, radio silence!
Dustin: Yeah, but we have a problem.
Hopper: What kind of problem?
[the creature is still roaring, hissing and snarling]
[it should have grown eyes as it missed Eleven and moves in the other way, snarling]
[creature growling as it nears the car]
[squelching footsteps]
[snarling]
[Nancy watches the creature throw away a dead guard in the wing mirror of the car, panting]
[the creature growling]
Mike: It's turned away. If we go up the stairs now, we'll make it.
Max: No way, not with El's leg.
Mike: We have to try.
Eleven: There's another way... to get out. Through the Gap.
[creature snarling]
Mike: [panting] [whispers] Okay. Now.
[all panting as they run into the Gap]
[dramatic synth music playing]
[they run over the broken window, broken glass clinking]
[Max gasps, knocking over a handbag that wasn't there in the previous shot]
[the creature turns to face the Gap after hearing Max gasp, not the clinking glass, and roars]
[the creature moves towards them, screeching and growling]
[snarling and screeching, it moves as far as it can into the store]
[it releases some tentacles to search the store as it is too heckin lorge, the tentacles screeching]
[creature snarling]
[tentacle chitters, screeches and roars when it sees Eleven's shirt]
[it has been played for a fool as Eleven had bought her shirt at the Gap and the tentacle has gone and attacked a mannequin]
[the creature snarls and throws the mannequin away]
[it nearly lands on Mike, him, Eleven and Max panting]
[Murray opens up the grate]
[he's so happy, he doesn't remember to be annoyed at his codename]
Murray: Bald Eagle has landed. Repeat. [panting] Bald Eagle has landed.
[Hopper sighs]
Murray: [looks through his notes] Okay.
Hopper: Come on, how much longer?
Murray: I don't know, I've never done this before! Okay. [figures out Alexei's notes, may he rest in peace] Okay, okay! Get ready, lovebirds, you're almost up to bat.
[creature lowing]
[tentacle squealing as it searches]
[tentacle chitters, snarls]
[tentacle screeching]
[alarm blaring as Murray turns off the switches and pulls out wires]
[indistinct Russian chatter]
[electricity crackling]
[powering down noise]
[buzzer sounds]
[alarm blaring]
[Hopper and Joyce see the light flashing and leave the room quickly]
[creature snarls]
Jonathan: Oh, shit.
[Lucas grabs his wrist rocket, panting]
Nancy: What are you doing?
Lucas; Don't worry.
[tentacle hissing]
[tentacle screeches, close to Eleven, Mike and Max]
[Lucas readies the wrist rocket and for some reason closes his eyes which he needs to aim]
[the tentacle is literally pulling a velociraptor in Jurassic Park move, screeching beside Mike]
[Lucas aims at a balloon and pops it, ducking back down]
[ the creature turns and snarls]
[creature screeching]
[the tentacle squeals and shoots back to the creature]
[Jonathan watches the creature move away from the Gap]
Jonathan: Go! Go, go, go, go, go, go!
[their part of the Griswold family run into a nearby store]
Mike: Let's go.
[they run off into the tunnels]
[both groups run through the tunnels]
[they run up some stairs]
[alarm blaring]
[indistinct female voice on PA]
Hopper: Let's go.
[they run past soldiers yelling in Russian]
[they bump into a guard walking out the room they want to go into]
Guard: [in Russian] Did Mikhail send for you?
[they smile and nod]
[female voice speaking Russian on PA]
[the guard runs off and they go into the room]
[Joyce gasps and they go over to the panel, Joyce getting out their notes]
Hopper: All right.
Joyce: Okay.
Hopper: Give me the code.
Joyce: Okay. Six-six-two, six-oh-eight, oh-oh-four.
[panel beeps with a red light]
[Hopper tries to open the door because a red light definitely means it's open, straining because it's surprisingly locked]
Hopper: [gasps] Uh... again?
Joyce; Six-six-two, six-oh-eight, oh-oh-four.
[panel beeps with a red light again]
Hopper: Murray? Your goddamn code... is wrong.
Murray: What? Are you sure?
Hopper: Yeah, I'm sure.
Murray: Well, I- I suppose it could be wrong.
Hopper: How could it be wrong?
Murray: The code is a number, a famous number. Planck's constant I- I thought I knew it.
[Murray and Hopper argue]
Dustin: Planck's constant.
Erica: You know it?
Dustin: Not by heart. You?
Erica: I'm not a nerd, nerd.
Murray: He told me it was Planck's constant, which I know. Why would I need him to give me a number I already know?
[Dustin plays with the tower, static hissing]
Erica: What are you doing?
[radio static whines]
[the Griswold Family run out of the shopping center]
Jonathan: Go, go, go!
[Billy's car engine revs]
[loud revving]
Jonathan: Shit.
Nancy: Get the car started. Go!
[Nancy cocks her gun]
[Jonathan tries to turn on the engine, the engine sputtering]
Jonathan: No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. Come on.
[engine revs]
[Billy starts his car, the tires screeching]
Lucas: Come on.
Will: We gotta go!
[Nancy shoots at Billy's car, smashing the windshield]
Jonathan: Come on!
[Billy's car gets closer]
Lucas: We gotta go!
[Nancy gasps and tries to move out of the way]
[the Todfather enters the chat and crashes into Billy's car at the last second, moving it out of the way]
[intense synth music playing]
[Steve panting]
[Nancy panting]
[Billy's car sets on fire for added drama]
Steve: Are you okay?
Robin: Ask me tomorrow?
[creature snarling]
Robin: [gasps] Oh, shit!
[the creature appears on the roof of Starcourt, snarling and growling]
[roaring]
[car horn honking, Nancy's car parks suddenly beside them]
Nancy: Get in!
[creature roaring as Steve and Robin get in the car]
Lucas: Go, go, go, go!
Steve: Go, go, go!
[creature screeches as Jonathan drives off, leaving Eleven, Max and Mike behind as they're not in the car]
[the creature climbs down off the roof, roaring]
[it follows the car]
[crickets chirping]
[distant dog barking]
[radio static crackling]
Dustin: Suzie, do you copy?
[Suzie gasps and puts down The Tales of Earthsea]
Dustin: Suzie, do you copy? Suzie, do you copy?
Suzie: This is Suzie. I copy.
Dustin: Suzie!
Suzie: Dusty-bun?
Erica: "Dusty-bun"?
Suzie: Where have you been?
Dustin: I'm so, so sorry. I- I've been really busy... uh, trying to save the world from Russians and monsters.
Suzie: [chuckles] Of course you have.
Erica: Get the goddamn number already!
Suzie: Who was that?
Dustin: [stammers] It was... Uh, I don't know, actually. I think it was just some interference. 
Dustin: So, why don't we, uh, change frequency to 14.158?
Suzie: Copy that, shifting frequency. Standby.
[radio whines]
[the creature is still following the car]
[Steve and Robin panting]
[they look at the radio as soon as they hear Suzie's voice]
Suzie: Dusty-bun, you copy?
Dustin: I copy, Suzie-poo. It sounds much better now, thanks.
Steve and Robin: Suzie.
Dustin: Okay, so, listen...
Dustin: Do you know Planck's constant?
Suzie: Do you know the Earth orbits the sun?
Dustin: [snickers] Okay, so I know it starts with two sixes, and then a... W-What is it?
Suzie: Okay, let me just be clear on this. I haven't heard from you in a week, and now you want a mathematical equation that you should know so you can... save the world?
Dustin: Suzie-poo, I promise, I will make it up to you as soon as possible.
Suzie: You can make it up to me now.
Dustin: What?
Suzie: I want to hear it.
Dustin: Not right now.
Suzie: Yes, now, Dusty-bun.
Dustin: Suzie-poo, this is urgent.
Suzie: Yes, yes, you're saving the world, I heard you the first time, but Ged is also saving Earthsea and he's about to confront the shadow, so this is Suzie, signing off.
Dustin: Wait, wait, wait! Okay. Okay. Okay.

[Billy opens the car door and gets out]
[ominous synth music playing]
[Billy coughs and groans, standing up]
[he grunts]
[he looks over to the gate, hearing a buzzer sounding]
[he sees Mike and Max carrying El]
Max: Shit!
Mike: Go, go, go, go, go, go, go!
[they immediately turn around and head back into Starcourt]
[Billy heads after them]
[the kids move, panting]
[Max quickly runs back and presses the button to close the gate, the buzzer sounds]
[creature shrieks and turns back]
Steve: It's turning around.
Nancy: What?
Steve: It's turning around!
Lucas: Maybe we wore it out.
Jonathan: I don't think so. Hold on.

[scientists clamoring as he shoots his gun which magically has more bullets in it]
[Joyce walks over to the glass and looks at the gate]
Hopper: Hey. You ready to end this?
[Joyce nods and Hopper opens the briefcase and grabs the keys]
Mike: In here. In here. Okay. Come on, come on, come on...
[Mike starts pressing a button rapidly]
[Billy opens a door and starts walking over]
Max: Billy. Billy, you don't have to do this. Billy. Your name's Billy, Billy Hargrove. You live on 4819 Cherry Lane. Billy, please, I'm Max, I'm your-
[Billy yells as he backhands Max]
[Mike grunts and runs over to try and help]
[Billy yells and throws this child into the wall]
[Eleven yells and stretches out her arm, trying to use her powers]
[Billy easily knocks her hand down]
[Eleven grunts, yelping when he pushes her head against the door and throws her into a wall, knocking her out]
[Billy grunts and picks her up]
Hopper: Murray, you all set down there?
Murray: All set, but I've got some company which I'd love you to obliterate.
Hopper: Will do. Hang tight.
[they insert the keys, the control panel beeping]
Hopper: On three.
Joyce: On three.
Hopper: One...
[Joyce exhales]
Hopper; Two-
[Hopper turns and gets grabbed by Grigori, groans]
[Joyce gasps as Hopper gets thrown to the ground]
[Joyce yelps, grunting as Grigori catches her on her way to the gun] 
[Joyce squeals, pants]
[Joyce screams and Grigori grunts as he throws her]
[Joyce yelps in pain]
Grigori: [in Russian] The Americans, I've found them-

[fighting grunts as they punch each other]
[Hopper grunts, groaning as he's punched to the floor]
[Billy walks into Scoops Ahoy from the tunnels]
[he lifts the safety grate and carries her into the center of the mall]

Billy: [whispers] Don't be afraid. It'll be over soon. Just try and stay... very still.
[creature snarling]
[it climbs back into Starcourt, its footsteps rumbling]
[Eleven whimpering and gasping]
[creature lowing and growling]
[it opens its mouth, hissing]
[a tentacle comes out, screeching]
[creature wails as a firework suddenly goes off on its back]
Lucas: Flay this, you ugly piece of shit!
[he throws another firework, the creature screeching]
[more fireworks hit it, the creature screeching]
[fireworks crackling, Jonathan and Nancy also throwing them]

[fireworks whistling]
[Billy screams]
[Eleven tries to crawl away, panting]
[she screams when Billy grabs her and drags her back to the creature]
[Eleven screaming]
[creature roaring]
[Joyce gets up slowly]
[console beeping]
[Hopper yells, grabbing Grigori's leg and knocking him over]
[Grigori groans as Hopper hits him in the stomach]
[Grigori wails]
[Hopper grunts]
[Grigori knocks Hopper over him, Hopper's head dangerously close to the spinning laser]
[Grigori puts his boot on Hopper's neck and grunts]

Steve: Dustin! We're out of time!
Dustin: Hurry! Close it now!
Dustin: [on radio] Close it!
[console beeping]
[Joyce takes off her belt and tries to create a pulley system that'll turn both keys at the same time]
[she tries to reach the other key, straining]
Joyce: Come on!
[Max wakes up in the tunnels, that was a very strong backhand from Billy]
Max: Mike... Mike. [tries to wake him up] Mike. Mike. Mike. Mike, get up. Mike, can you hear me? Mike! Mike!
[Mike whimpers]
Max: Hey, come on. You okay?
Mike: Where's El?

[young Billy and his mom laughing]
Young Billy: Leave me alone!
Billy's Mom: Stop it!
Young Billy: Mom!
Billy's Dad: This is your new sister.
Young Billy: ...at least seven feet.
[distorted screaming]
Eleven: Seven... feet. [gasps]
[fireworks crackling]
[gentle music playing]
Eleven: You told her... the wave was seven feet.
Billy's mom: Woo! Yeah! [laughs]
[Eleven cries]
Eleven: You ran to her, on the beach.
[flashback of laughing]
Eleven: There were seagulls.
[flashback of squawking]
Eleven: She wore a hat...
[Billy sniffles]
Eleven: ...with a blue ribbon.
[Billy gasps]
Eleven: A long dress... with a blue and red flower. Yell- Yellow sandals, covered in sand. She was pretty.
[flashback of laughing]
Eleven: She was really pretty. And you... you were happy.
[Billy closes his eyes, a single tear falling]
[Grigori has his boot on Hopper's neck, pushing him towards the rotating laser]
[Joyce straining to reach both keys]
[Hopper groans, trying to push the boot off his neck]
[he pushes the boot to the side, both grunting]
[Hopper grabs his shirt and Grigori screams as his face collides with the railing]
[Grigori throws a punch, Hopper catches it and grunts, pushing him back]
[Grigori wails as Hopper pushes his thumb into Grigori's shoulder]
Hopper: [grabs Grigori's] I'll see you in hell!
[Grigori grunts as he's thrown into the laser]
[Hopper gasps at the sight of Grigori simultaneously wrapping around the laser like a cartoon piece of taffy and exploding into tiny pieces]
[electricity whooshing]
[Hopper quickly realises that his exit has been cut off]
[fireworks whistling and crackling]
Nancy: Hit me.
[Jonathan lights the firework]
[she throws it and grunts]
[creature roaring]
Will: We're out!
Lucas: Damn it!
[the fireworks stop, the creature roaring]
[it goes over to Billy and El, snarling and roaring]
[roaring continues as Max and Mike appear]
[creature screeching]
[its mouth opens and a tentacle comes out, snarling and roaring]
[El tries to back away on the ground]
[the tentacle shoots at El but Billy catches it]
Billy: No!
[Billy yells, holding it back]
[Max watches in shock as the creature keeps screeching]
[Billy yells]
[more tentacles appear, the creature shrieking]
[a tentacle attaches itself to Billy's side, Billy screams in pain]
[creature screeches as another tentacle attacks Billy]
[Billy screams as another two tentacles grab him and lift him into the air]
[Max watches in horror, Eleven in shock]
Dustin: Close it now! Close it!
[dramatic synth music playing]
[Russians in hazmat suits approach the laser]
[Joyce straining, but she grabs the key]
[she looks at Hopper and Hopper looks back at her]
[he knows he won't make it to Enzo's on Friday]
[the creature lowers Billy to his knees, roaring]
[Billy screams, blood coming out of his mouth, a true Boromir of this situation]
[the creature pierces his chest with a sixth tentacle, roaring]
Max: Billy!
[Billy grunts as the sixth tentacle retreats from his body]
[the other five tentacles also retreat, Billy falling to the ground as a martyr]
[Hopper, with tears in his eyes, nods to Joyce]
[Joyce looks back at him, tears in her eyes]
[Hopper smiles at her, telling her 'it'll be okay' with his face even though he's lying]
[Joyce closes her eyes and turns the keys]
[the laser falls apart, completely obliterating the hazmatted Russians]
[we do not see nor do we want to see what it did to Hopper]
[electricity crackling]
[the gate reseals]
[the creature reels back, screeching]
[snarling, it wildly attacks anything around it but not Eleven as too many people have died this day]
[Steve and Robin duck on the second floor of the mall to avoid its legs, the creature roaring]
[groaning, it falls to the ground]
[dramatic synth music playing]
[Steve and Robin get up and look at the creature]
[the creature makes a weak snarling sound which is akin to a machine powering down]
[the creature is no more]
[Joyce, crying, looks for Hopper]
[the platform is empty]
[Eleven panting]
[Mike runs over to her]
Mike: El.
Eleven: Mike!
[Eleven sobs and whimpers, hugging Mike close]
[Max walks over]
Max: Billy?
[Billy coughing on the ground]
[Max kneels beside him]
Max: Billy. Billy, Billy, get up, please. Billy, get up, please, please.
Billy: I'm sorry.
Max: Billy...
[Billy exhales sharply and dies]
Max: [shaking him] Billy. Billy. Billy, wake up. Billy, get up. Please, Billy... [sobs] Billy! Billy... [sniffles] Billy...
[Eleven pulls Max into a hug]
Eleven: I'm sorry.
[Max sobbing]
Eleven: It's okay. It's okay. It's okay. It's okay.
[Joyce walks over to where she saw Hopper, crying]
Joyce: [sobbing] Hop.
Murray: [runs over and grabs her] Jim. Where's Jim?
[Joyce looks at Murray, he realises Hopper's gone]
[Russian soldiers break into the control room]
[Joyce gasps]
[a guard starts yelling in Russian as Murray and Joyce try to run]
[they run into the room where Murray came out of the grate]
[Dustin and Erica watch over Hawkins]
[several helicopters fly over towards Starcourt, blades whirring]
[the helicopters land and soldiers get out]
Soldier: Let's go! Go! Come on!
[Dr. Owens appears and walks towards the mall with the soldiers]
[soldiers yelling indistinctly]
[Murray helps Joyce out of the vent]
Murray: You all right?
[the doors open and soldiers rush in, pointing guns at them]
Soldiers: [yelling] Hands up!
Murray: Don't shoot! American! We're Americans! Americans!
[soldiers yelling indistinctly as they check out the base]
[soldiers yelling indistinctly, absolutely swarming the place]
[Dr. Owens stands in front of where the gate was]
[he stares at it, angry and bewildered]
[ominous synth music playing]
[sirens wailing as the mall goes up in flames]
Fireman: Hey, come on, let's go! Go, go!
[several firemen run inside to check for anyone inside and to put out the fire]
[indistinct radio chatter]
[soldiers march Joyce and Murray outside]
[sirens wailing]
[emotional synth music playing]
[Joyce looks around for the kids and sees Will sat in the back of an ambulance with the other kids]
[Joyce sobs as Will runs to her and hugs her]
Joyce: Thank God!
[Joyce looks up and sees Eleven looking for Hopper]
[helicopters flying overhead]
[Joyce sobbing]
[Eleven looks at Joyce]
[from Joyce's look, she realises that Hopper has gone]
[Eleven shakes her head and starts crying alone in the rain]
[news fanfare playing]
Male reporter: Welcome to Hawkins, Indiana, a wonderful place to grow up, to raise your family, to walk your dog. But then...
[sirens wailing]
Male reporter: ...on July Fourth, everything changed. A terrible tragedy struck this small town. But this was not this small town's first brush with tragedy. Mysterious deaths, government cover-ups, a bizarre chemical leak. Is it all linked? All a vast conspiracy? The fault of a disgraced, corrupt mayor? Or is something more going on in the heartland? Can a town itself be cursed?
[woman screams]
Male reporter: Some believe a rise in Satanism is to blame.
[eerie cackling laughter]
Male reporter: To find out, tune in tonight at 8:00 p.m. for "Horror in the Heartland" on Cutting Edge.
[indistinct chatter]
[Steve parks outside and heads inside with Robin]
Robin: You put your mom down as a reference?
Steve: Yeah. Why not? She's, like, super well-respected.
Robin: You're such a dingus.
Steve: Wha-
[he follows her inside]
[they give their letters to Keith]
Robin: Uh, just to be clear, we weren't fired, you know. The mall burned down and, like, killed a bunch of people.
Keith: Thanks for sharing. Didn't know. Three favorite movies. Go.
Robin: Uh... The Apartment, Hidden Fortress, Children of Paradise.
Keith: You, go.
Steve: Favorite movies?
Keith: Did I stutter?
Steve: Uh... Animal House, for sure.
[Robin scoffs]
Steve: Um...
[he looks around for inspiration]
Keith: Eyes on me, Harrington.
Steve: Yeah. Uh... Star Wars.
[Robin looks like she regrets going with him to this 'interview' as anyone else would because who wouldn't prepare a list of their favourite movies when you're basically applying to Blockbuster?]
Keith: A New Hope?
Steve: A new what-now?
Keith: Which Star Wars? 
Steve: The one with the teddy bears. Duh. [squeals like an Ewok]
[Robin hangs her head in shame, a reaction that clearly says she made a blood pact to help him get this job]
Steve: No? Uh... Oh, the one that just came out. The movie that just came out. The one with the DeLorean and Alex P. Keaton, and he's trying to bang his mom. [chuckles] The time... Yeah, those are my top three. Classics.
[Keith looks at Robin and points so there's no confusion]
Keith: You start Monday.
[he points at Steve]
Keith: You start never.
Robin: [leans over to Steve] Will you just, um... Will you give us a minute?
Steve: Why?
Robin: Steve.
[Steve backs away, yanking his resume aggressively]
[Robin scoffs at how childish he's being]
Robin: All right, you have to understand, Keith, I know his taste is a bit pedestrian, but the dingus has other qualities.
Keith: He's a douchebag of the highest order, Robin.
Robin: He was a bit of a prick to us in high school, I'll grant you that, but he remains... a total chick magnet.
Keith: Yeah, okay, and this is relevant to me how?
Robin: Uh, Earth to Keith. The ladies will come in just to see him. They'll come in in droves. Droves, Keith. We sold so much ice cream, they had to get a second shipment in from Michigan. Goddamn Michigan, Keith. And these ladies... [inhales sharply] These ladies are hot. They're so very hot. And there are too many of them for little Steve.
[Keith smirks weirdly, definitely has weird tastes in women and is possibly a stalker]
Robin: He needs assistance. He needs your assistance, Keith.
Keith: What's in it for you? You got a thing for him or something?
[Steve walks around the VHSes and knocks over a standee]
[he catches it, still falling]
Steve: Goddammit. This is- Hm.
[he realises it's a half-naked woman and immediately perks back up, trying to stand the standee back where it was]
[Steve is basically just a labrador puppy loose in this store]
Robin: We're just, um... We're just friends.
Steve: Oh! Fast Times. Fast Times. Ever heard of it? Top three for me, Keith.
[Robin laughs at him making a fool of himself]
[Jonathan carries a mattress out of the house with Nancy]
Jonathan: Whoa, whoa, whoa! Slow down.
Nancy: Sorry. Sorry. Still got it?
Jonathan: Yeah, yeah.
[they put it in the truck]
Max and Lucas: [packing and singing] ♪ Turn around, Look at what you see, In her face, The mirror of your dreams, Rhymes that keep their secrets, Will unfold behind the clouds ♪
[Dustin is on the other side of the room surrounded by boxes, watching them like a dog watching its owner eat all their food and not give it any]
Max: Wait, did we get that verse right? It's "unfold behind the clouds"?
Dustin: Yeah, but you're butchering it, so could you please stop?
Lucas: So then join in, Dusty-bun. [blows air kiss]
Max: Yeah, come on, Dusty-bun, why don't you join us? 
Dustin: You guys are so funny, you should be on Carson.
Max: Can't we just hear your rendition?
Dustin: No.
Max: Please? Just one verse?
Dustin: No. No way. It's reserved for Suzie's ears and Suzie's ears alone.
Max and Lucas: [wait a beat and look at each other] ♪ Turn around, Look at what you see, In their face ♪

Max and Lucas: ♪ The mirror of your dreams ♪
Dustin: Shut up, you guys.
Max and Lucas: ♪ Rhymes that keep their secrets ♪
Dustin: Stop! You guys, please, shut up.
[Will walks and puts his Dungeons and Dragons stuff in the donation box]
Mike: Whoa, dude. That's the donation box.
Will: I know. I'll just use yours when I come back. I mean, if we still wanna play.
Mike: Yeah, but what if you want to join another party?
Will: Not possible.
[Mike chuckles]
[Jonathan sighs and looks at his old room]
Nancy: Is that... everything?
Jonathan: I guess so. [sighs] Seventeen years of my life... packed up in one day.
[Nancy hugs him]
Nancy; What if I just... don't let you go?
Jonathan: I think... the new owners might kick us out.
Nancy: You could stay in our basement.
Jonathan: Your dad'd love that.
Nancy: We could hide you in a tent, like El.
Jonathan: Hey.
[Nancy sighs]
Jonathan: It's gonna be okay. [sighs and looks at their matching scars] As a wise man once said... we've got shared trauma.
Nancy: So what's a little more, right?
Jonathan: [chuckles] What's a little more?
[Jonathan chuckles softly and kisses her]
[in another room, Eleven packs her clothes away]
[she's wearing her hair up for once and has one of Hopper's shirts on]
[she reaches up to grab a teddy bear, strains and sighs]
[she tries using her powers]
[weak high frequency vibration]
[vibration intensifies then stops]
[Eleven pants, no nosebleed]
Mike: They'll come back. I know they will.
[he easily grabs the teddy because he's nearly 6' tall but he's only a child and oh my god they're growing up]
Eleven: Thanks.
Mike: You packed your walkie, right?
Eleven: Yes.
Mike: Because you know that I'm gonna steal Cerebro from Dustin and call you so much, you're gonna have to turn it off, right?
[both chuckle]
Eleven: Did you talk to your mom? About Thanksgiving?
Mike: Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I got the okay. I'll be there. And then I was thinking maybe you could come up here for Christmas. And Will, too. You can come before or after Christmas, or whatever Mrs. Byers wants, but I was thinking Christmas Day could be super fun, because we'd all have cool new presents to play with and, uh... [chuckles] Sorry, that made me sound like a seven-year-old.
Eleven: I like presents, too. 
[hint hint Mike, you'd better not forget like you forgot about Dustin this season]
Mike: Yeah, cool. Yeah. I like- I like presents, too.
Eleven: Cool.
[she starts walking out of the room and turns around, looking at what she sees, the need to say something in her face]
Eleven: Mike?
Mike: Yeah?
Eleven: [sighs] Remember that day... at the cabin, you were talking to Max?
Mike: Um... I don't think I follow.
Eleven: You talked about your- your feelings, your heart.
Mike: Oh. Oh, yeah, that. Man, that was so long ago. Um... That was really heat of the moment stuff, and we were arguing and... I don't really remember... What did I say, exactly? [definitely remembers but wants to see cool I guess]
Eleven: Mike...
[emotional synth music playing as she walks over to him]
Eleven: I love you, too.
[she kisses him and walks off]
[Joyce is sorting through Hopper's things]
[she finds the speech he wrote for Eleven]
[Joyce clicks tongue, sighs]
[Eleven walks in]
Eleven: Donation box?
Joyce: [looks at the teddy] Uh, yeah, sure.
[Joyce clears throat]
Eleven: What is that?
Joyce: Uh... It- It's the speech Hop wrote for you and Mike.
Eleven: Speech?
Joyce: Yeah. You know, the heart-to-heart.
[Eleven looks confused]
Joyce: He never talked to you, did he? 
[Eleven shakes her head]
[Joyce scoffs]
Eleven: Can I read?
[Eleven takes it to an empty room, lies down and reads it]
[Hopper is going through the speech in the cabin]
Hopper: "There's something I've been wanting to talk to you both about. I know this is a difficult conversation, but I care about you both very much. And I know that you care about each other very much. And that's why it's important that we set these boundaries moving forward, so we can build an environment... where we all feel... comfortable... trusted... and open... to sharing our feelings." Feelings.
[he grabs his pen and sits down at the table]
Hopper: [murmurs] Feelings. Jesus. [chuckles]
[Joyce, Eleven and Will say goodbye to everyone]
[there are many tears from Will as well as hugs from everyone]
Hopper's Voice: The truth is, for so long, I'd forgotten what those even were. I've been stuck in one place, in a cave, you might say. A deep, dark cave. And then, I left some Eggos out in the woods, and you came into my life and... for the first time in a long time, I started to feel things again.
[Jonathan and Nancy say goodbye]
Hopper's Voice: I started to feel happy.
[Mike, Max, Dustin, Nancy and Lucas watch the truck and Jonathan's car drive away]
Hopper's Voice: But, lately, I guess I've been feeling... distant from you. Like you're... you're pulling away from me or something. 
[we see Hopper's cabin, abandoned and dusty, boardgames in the rubble]
Hopper's Voice: I miss playing board games every night, making triple-decker Eggo extravaganzas at sunrise, watching westerns together before we doze off.
[Eleven cries in the truck, looking out the window]
Hopper's Voice: But I know you're getting older. Growing.
[MIke stays for a second as Max, Lucas, Nancy and Dustin head off] 
Hopper's Voice: Changing. And I guess... if I'm being really honest, that's what scares me.
[Will looks out of Jonathan's car window, crying]
Hopper's Voice: I don't want things to change.
[Mike arrives home, crying]
[Karen hugs him]
Hopper's Voice: So, I think maybe that's why I came in here, to try to maybe... stop that change. To turn back the clock. To make things go back to how they were.
[Joyce drives the truck out of Hawkins]
[Hopper sighs deeply]
Hopper's Voice: But I know that's naive. It's just... not how life works. It's moving. Always moving, whether you like it or not.
[Max sits in Billy's room, nothing has moved]
Hopper's Voice: And, yeah, sometimes it's painful. Sometimes it's sad.
[Erica opens her door to see Dustin and Lucas with the donations box]
Hopper's Voice: And sometimes... it's surprising. Happy.
[Erica opens the box and finds Will's Dungeons and Dragons things]
Hopper's Voice: So, you know what? Keep on growing up, kid.
[Hopper is smoking as he writes]
Hopper: Don't let me stop you. Make mistakes, learn from 'em, and when life hurts you, because it will, remember the hurt.
[Eleven cries as she reads it]
Hopper's Voice: The hurt is good. It means you're out of that cave.
[Hopper keeps writing with a smile on his face]
Hopper: But, please, if you don't mind, for the sake of your poor old dad...
[Eleven cries]
Hopper's Voice: Keep the door open three inches.
Eleven: [laughs] [sniffles] [sobs]

Joyce: Are you okay?
Eleven: Yeah. [sniffles] Time to go?
Joyce: Yeah.
Eleven: I'll be out in a minute.
Joyce: Okay.

[two guards walk into a jail]
[one goes to the third door]
Guard 2: [in Russian] No. Not the American.
[they go to the next door and unlock it, lock clicking]
Prisoner: [in Russian] No, I'm begging you... No! Don't! No! Please! No! Don't!
[they drag him out]
Prisoner: No, don't! Don't do this! Let me go!
[they drag him down flights of stairs]
Prisoner: [grunts] Let me go!
[prisoner yells in Russian]
[prisoner continues yelling]
[prisoner wails and grunts]
[the guards throw him to the ground, prisoner grunts]
[the guards lock the door]
Prisoner: [muttering in Russian] Don't leave me in here. [muttering in Russian]  Let me out, I'm innocent. I'm innocent! I'm begging you, please!
[a guard turns a wheel, metal squealing]
[door hinge squealing, a dark mist appearing as it opens]
[the prisoner backs against the wall]
[something walks out, snarling]
[a pale Demogorgon comes out, snarling and growling on all fours]
[Demogorgon shrieks]
[snarling and squealing]
[snarling]
[it finally stands on its back legs and chitters]
[squelching and clicking as it walks over to the prisoner]
[snarling]
[the prisoner screams]
[the Demogorgon's face opens, screeching]
[it lunges]
