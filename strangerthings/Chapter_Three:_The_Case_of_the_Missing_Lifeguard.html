</p><p>Hopper: Yeah. 
</p><p>Joyce: Yeah, it fell in the night. It lost its magnetism.
</p><p>Hopper: Oh, did it?
</p><p>Joyce: And the same exact thing happened at my house the day before.
</p><p>Hopper: Wow.
</p><p>Joyce: And I thought, "Okay, that's weird." Right? Why are all these magnets suddenly losing their magnetism?
</p><p>Hopper: Uh-huh?
</p><p>Joyce: So, I went and saw Scott.
</p><p>Hopper: Scott. Who's Scott?
</p><p>Joyce: Scott Clarke.
</p><p>Hopper: Your child's science teacher?
</p><p>Hopper: He's pretty brilliant, actually. And I asked him, "How is this happening?" And he built this magnetic field using an AC transformer and plugging it into a solenoid. And- And with that solenoid, which basically-
</p><p>Hopper: Slow down, slow down. I just want to get this exactly right, okay? You stand me up...
</p><p>[Joyce sighs]
</p><p>Hopper: ...no phone call, no apology, because you had to go to Scott Clarke's house.
</p><p>Joyce: Yeah.
</p><p>Hopper: [scoffs] [chuckles] You've outdone yourself, Joyce. You really have. No, you've outdone yourself.
</p><p>Joyce: Oh, come on, Hop, you're not even listening to me. Scott was able to demagnetize some of the magnets, and he thinks-
</p><p>Hopper: I don't care what Scott thinks!
</p><p>Joyce: He thinks that a large-scale magnetic field could be built using some sort of machine or- or experimental technology.
</p><p>Hopper: He's brilliant, isn't he? He's really brilliant. Is he single too?
</p><p>Joyce: [scoffs] What if it's them? To build a machine like this, you need resources. You need scientists, you need funding, tens of millions of dollars.
</p><p>Hopper: Joyce.
</p><p>Joyce: It can't just be a coincidence, Hopper. It has to be them.
</p><p>Hopper: Joyce, stop.
</p><p>Joyce: It has to be the lab.
</p><p>Hopper: It is impossible.
</p><p>Joyce: Well, then, prove it to me.
</p><p>Hopper: Prove it?
</p><p>Joyce: Yeah, take me back there.
</p><p>Hopper: To the lab.
</p><p>Joyce: Yeah, I wanna go back.
</p><p>Hopper: Because some magnets fell off your fridge.
</p><p>Joyce: Yes.
</p><p>Hopper: Okay, makes sense.
</p><p>Joyce: [scoffs] Thank you.
</p><p>Hopper: It makes sense. I'm sorry. I'm a little busy right now, but maybe we can meet up there, like tonight, like seven o'clock? You know, of course, unless something comes up which, you know, it will.
</p><p>Joyce: You know, after everything that's happened, this is no joke.
</p><p>[Hopper goes into his room and closes the curtain to get dressed]
</p><p>Hopper: No, I don't think it's a joke. I think that when I asked you out, I think you got scared. I think you got scared, and now, you're inventing things. You're inventing things to get worked up about so that you can push me away. Because God forbid any of us move on! Because that... that would be... [chuckles] I mean, that would be too much, right, Joyce? You know? That would be too much, wouldn't it, Joyce? Wouldn't it, Joyce?

</p><p>Eleven: But the screams.
</p><p>Max: Yeah, I know, but here's the thing. When Billy is alone with a girl, they make, like, really crazy noises.

</p><p>Dustin: Camp Know Where, actually. And no, it's shit I learned from life.
</p><p>Steve: Hm.
</p><p>Dustin: Instead of dating somebody you think's gonna make you cooler, why not date somebody you actually enjoy being around? Like me and Suzie.
</p><p>Steve: Oh, Suzie. Yeah, you mean, "hotter than Phoebe Cates."
</p><p>Dustin: Yeah, that Suzie.
</p><p>Steve: And, uh, let's think about how exactly did you score that beautiful girlfriend? Oh, yeah. With my advice. Because that's how this works, Henderson. I give you the advice, you follow through. Not the other way around, all right, pea-brain?
