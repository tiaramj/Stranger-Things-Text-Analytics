Script: 
[Jonathan looks for Nancy]
Jonatha: Nancy! Nancy! Come on, come on. Nancy! Where are you?
[Nancy runs around, trying to find Jonathan]
Nancy: (echoing) Jonathan! Jonathan! Jonathan! Jonathan, I'm right here!
Jonathan: Nancy! (breathing heavily) Nancy!
Nancy: Jonathan, where are you? Jonathan! (breathing heavily) Jonathan! Jonathan, I'm right... I'm right here! (faintly) Where are you?
Jonathan: I'm right here!
[Nancy's voice echoes from the Upside Down]
Nancy: Jonathan! 
Jonathan: I'm right here! Nancy! Just follow my voice!
Nancy: (panting) Jonathan!
[Jonathan's voice echoes from Mirkwood]
Jonathan: Follow my voice, Nancy, I'm right here!
[growling]
[Nancy gasps, seeing the demogorgon and runs]
[Jonathan runs to where Nancy's stuff is left]
Jonathan: Nancy!
[Jonathan pants as he sees the residue on the tree from the Upside Down]
[growling continues]
[Jonathan breathing heavily]
[Jonathan kneels before the tree]
Jonathan: Nancy? Nancy.
[Jonathan's voice echoes from Mirkwood]
Jonathan: Nancy! Follow my voice!
[monster growling]
[Nancy looks at the hole she entered from]
[Jonathan peers into the hole]
Jonathan: Nancy?
[Jonathan gasps as Nancy's hand bursts through]
Nancy: Jonathan!
Jonathan: Nancy!
[Jonathan grabs her hand and tries to pull her through]
[Nancy straining]
[Jonathan grunting]
[Nancy is pulled through]
[Nancy sobs and clings to Jonathan]
[Jonathan panting]
Jonathan: I got you.
[the hole in the tree seals up]
[pop song playing on car stereo]
[Steve is driving with Tommy and Carol in the car]
Carol: I just don't understand why we're coming out here. She obviously doesn't wanna talk to you.
Steve: That's... that's not it.
Carol: Oh, really? Because no girl would ever blow off King Steve.
Steve: She was acting weird. I mean, something was wrong.
Carol: So what? (scoffs) Like, you're worried about her?
Steve: What?
Carol: Aw, you are. Aw, Steve has a heart.
Steve: Would you just- Stop.
Tommy: Oh, Stevey's in love.
Steve: Would you just shut up?
Carol: Who knew?
Steve: Shut up!
Tommy: (chuckling) Jeez.
Carol: Damn. Sorry.
[Tommy chuckles]
[Steve parks and looks at the Wheeler House]
Tommy: (sighs) So this is it, huh? Princess' castle.
Steve: I'll just be a minute.
[Steve gets out of the car and starts climbing up to Nancy's room]
[Steve looks through the window and sees Jonathan wrap Nancy in a towel]
Joyce: Look, we gotta go through this again.
Hopper: I told you everything that I saw.
Joyce: Oh, gosh. Tell me again.
Hopper: Upstairs or downstairs?
Joyce:  Upstairs.
Hopper: There was a laboratory. It was where they must do experiments or something, and then there was... (inhales deeply) There was this kid's room. 
Joyce: How do you know it was a kid's room?
Hopper: More like a prison.
Joyce: So why would you think it was a kid's room, then?
Hopper: Because, I told you, the size of the bed, there was a drawing, there was a stuffed animal-
Joyce: You didn't say there was a drawing.
Hopper: Yeah, there was a drawing of a... an adult and a child. It said "Eleven" on it.
Joyce: Was it good?
Hopper: It was a kid's drawing, Joyce. It was stick figures.
Joyce: Wasn't Will.
Hopper: Earl... The night that Benny died, Earl said he saw some kid with a shaved head with Benny Now, I pressed him, he said it might be Will, but maybe... 
Joyce: Wait... Maybe, it wasn't?
Hopper: Look... this woman, Terry Ives, she claims to have lost her daughter, Jane. She sued Brenner, she sued the government... Now, the claims came to nothing, but what if... I mean, what if this whole time I've been... I've been looking for Will... I've been chasing after some other kid?
[Nancy washes off all the blood and decay from the Upside Down]
[as she washes, she thinks of what happened that night]
[Jonathan rolls out a sleeping bag onto the floor]
[Nancy walks back in]
Jonathan: Better?
Nancy: Yeah.
Jonathan: Is this okay? Uh, I found it in the closet. I can go home. I just figured-
[Jonathan stands]
Nancy: Yeah, no. I... I don't wanna be alone. Do you?
Jonathan: No. Uh... no.
[Nancy gets into bed]
[Jonathan gets into the sleeping bag]
Nancy: Can you just come up here?
[Jonathan sits up and gets out of the sleeping bag]
Jonathan: Yeah.
[Jonathan puts the gun under the pillow and lies on the covers]
Jonathan: Do you want the lights off, or-
Nancy: On.
Jonathan: Yeah. You know, it... it can't get us in here.
Nancy: We don't know that.
[Mike plays with a Rubix Cube]
[he looks at the door and then to the den where Eleven has been sleeping. It's empty]
[Mike goes over and starts kicking it, crying]
[Hopper is seen in a phone booth]
Hopper: Uh, yeah, it's Ives. Terry Ives. That's with a "Y." Yeah, I got a pen. Hang on. Mmm-hmm. Mmm-hmm. Great, thanks. I really appreciate this, Frank. Say hi to the boys for me, too, would you?
[Hopper hangs up and heads to the car]
Joyce; Did you get it?
Hopper: I got it.
Joyce: Okay.
[Hopper drives off in a hurry]
[Jonathan wakes up, grunting softly]
[pages rustling]
Jonathan: Oh... Hey.
[Jonathan sits up beside Nancy]
Nancy: Hey.
Jonathan: Couldn't sleep?
Nancy: Every time I close my eyes, I just... keep seeing that... thing. Wherever I was, that place... I think that it lives there. It was feeding there. Feeding on that deer. That means that if... if Will and Barbara...
Jonathan: Hey. My mom said she talked to Will. If he's alive, there's a chance Barbara is, too.
Nancy: That means that she's trapped... in that place. We have to find it again.
Jonathan: You wanna go back out there?
Nancy: Maybe we don't have to. When I saw it, it was feeding on that deer.
Jonathan: Meaning it's... it's a predator, right?
Nancy: Right. And it seems to hunt at night, like a... a lion or a coyote. But it doesn't hunt in packs like them. It's always alone, like... like a bear. And remember at Steve's, when Barb cut herself? And then, last night, the deer...
Jonathan: Hmm, it was bleeding, too.
Jonathan: So you're saying it can detect blood?
Nancy: It's just a theory. We could test it.
Jonathan: But if it works...
Nancy: At least we'll know it's coming.
[door knob rattles]
[both gasp and grab each other's hands]
[Nancy sighs]
Karen: Honey, are you up?
Nancy: Yeah, I'm... I'm getting dressed.
Karen: I, uh, made some blueberry pancakes.
Nancy: I'll be down in a second.
[footsteps receding]
[both sighs]
[both let go of each other]
Jonathan: Your mom doesn't knock?
[both chuckle]
[knocking on door]
Connie Frazier: Hi. Scott Clarke?
Mr. Clarke: Uh, yes.
Connie Frazier: The same Scott Clarke who teaches science and AV at Hawkins Middle?
Mr. Clarke: The very same.
Connie Frazier: Oh, wonderful. 
[cuts to her talking in his living room with him]
Connie Frazier: ...and we're making a newsletter, which we'll send out monthly. It'll showcase all the latest equipment, as well as how-to articles, which the kids write themselves.
Mr. Clarke: Oh, that's neat.
Connie Frazier: What we're really trying to do here, Mr. Clarke-
Mr. Clarke: Uh, please, call me Scott.
Connie Frazier: Scott. What we're trying to do here, Scott, is to connect kids from all over the state and give them the support and encouragement to pursue careers in technology. We feel these are the kinds of kids that are going to make Indiana proud.
Mr. Clarke: I agree, yes. Completely.
Connie Frazier: So, you know any kids you think might wanna participate?
Mr. Clarke: Oh, I have a few in mind...
[Mike sighs]
Mike: I just... I can't believe she didn't come back.
Dustin: She's gotta be close.
Mike: She said it wasn't safe. She just messed up the compasses because she wanted to protect us. She didn't betray us.
Dustin: Mike, calm down.
Mike: I shouldn't have yelled at her. I never should've done that.
Dustin: Mike, this isn't your fault.
Mike: Yeah, it's Lucas'.
Dustin: It wasn't his fault, either.
Mike: It wasn't his fault?
Dustin: No.
Mike: So you're saying he wasn't way out of line?
Dustin: Totally, but so were you!
Mike: What?
Dustin: And so was Eleven.
Mike: Oh, give me a break!
Dustin: No, Mike, you give me a break! All three of you were being a bunch of little assholes! I was the only reasonable one. But the bottom line is... you pushed first. And you know the rule. You draw first blood...
Mike; No! No way! I'm not shaking his hand.
Dustin: You're shaking his hand!
Mike: No, I'm not.
Dustin: This isn't a discussion. This is the rule of law. Obey or be banished from the party. Do you wanna be banished?
Mike: No.
Dustin: Good. 
Mike: Where are we going? 
Dustin: Where do you think? We're going to get Lucas. And then we're gonna find Eleven.
[he throws a bag at Mike]
[Eleven sleeping in her bed]
[door opens]
[Eleven breathes heavily]
[Brenner walks in and gives Eleven a plant]
Brenner: Today is a very special day. Do you know why? Because today, we make history. Today, we make contact.
[Eleven wakes up, breathing heavily]
[birds chirping]
[Eleven goes down to the river and puts the wig back on]
[she sighs and takes it off]
[she screams and makes the water splash]
[Karen feeds Holly some pancake]
Karen: Here you go. Ah... yum. Now, sweetie, swallow the pancake. 
Ted: Where is Nancy? I thought she was coming down.
Karen: She is. Uh, she was. I don't know.
[Karen heads upstairs]
Karen: Nancy, what's taking so long?
[music playing faintly]
Karen: Nancy?
[door knob rattles]
Karen: Nancy, come on.
[music continues]
[Karen takes a pin out of her hair and picks the lock]
Karen: Nan-
[she walks in and sees Nancy isn't there]
[doorbell rings]
[Lucas opens the door and sees Mike and Dustin]
Lucas: What do you want?
[Dustin hits Mike]
Mike: I drew first blood, so...
[they go up to Lucas' living room] 
Lucas: Okay, I'll shake. On one condition. We forget the weirdo and go straight to the gate.
Mike: Then the deal's off.
Lucas: Fine!
Mike: Fine!
Dustin No, no, not fine! Guys, seriously? Do you even remember what happened on the Bloodstone Pass?  We couldn't agree on what path to take, so we split up the party and those trolls took us out one by one. And it all went to shit. And we were all disabled! So we stick together, no matter what!
Lucas: Yeah, I agree. But this is the party, right here in this room.
Mike: El is one of us now.
Lucas: Um, no, she's not. Not even close! Never will be. She's a liar, a traitor-
Mike: She was just trying to keep us safe! She didn't mean to hurt you. It was an accident!
Lucas: An accident?
Dustin: All right, accident or not... admit it, it was a little awesome.
Lucas: Awesome?
Dustin: Yeah, she threw you in the air with her mind!
Lucas: I could have been killed!
Mike: Which is exactly why we need her. She's a weapon! Do you seriously wanna fight the Demogorgon with your wrist rocket? That's like R2-D2 going to fight Darth Vader. We're no use to Will if we're dead.
Lucas: If you two wanna waste your time looking for a traitor, go ahead, 'cause I'm not spending my time on her anymore. No way! I'm going to the gate. I'm gonna find Will.
[Eleven walks over to the store]
[upbeat music playing on PA]
[indistinct chatter]
[Eleven remembers being in the lab]
Dr. Brenner: It's okay, Eleven. Don't be frightened. These are all friends. They're just here to watch. Don't focus on them. Stay in here, like before.
Eleven: Yes, Papa.
Dr. Brenner: Now, remember. Whatever it is, it can't hurt you. Not from here. So there's nothing to be frightened of. It's reaching out to you... 'cause it wants you. Hmm? It's calling you... so don't turn away from it this time. I want you to find it. Understand?
Eleven: Yes.
[cuts back to present day]
Manager: Are you lost? Is your mom here? Your dad?
Eleven: Mouth breather.
[Eleven looks around and grabs some Eggo boxes]
Clerk: What should we do?
Manager: Uh... Call the police. Excuse me. Young lady! You know you have to pay for those! Hey! Stop right-
[woman screams as Eleven uses her powers to push a trolley in front of the manager]
Manager: Please. You have to pay for those! Stop right there! Thief! Thief!
[Eleven walks out of the store with the Eggos]
[she uses her powers to slam the doors closed, the glass shattering]
[Hopper and Joyce knock on the door]
Becky: Can I help you?
Hopper: Hi, we're looking for Terry Ives. Does she live here?
Becky: Who's asking?
Hopper: The Hawkins chief of police.
Becky: And you want to talk to my sister?
Hopper: Well, if your sister's Terry Ives, then, yeah, we do.
Becky: Okay, well, you can come in, but if you want Terry to tell you anything, you're about five years too late.
[she leads them into the house]
[TV playing indistinctly]
Becky: Terry, you have some visitors.
Hopper: What was your relationship with Dr. Brenner? You guys keep in touch? 
Joyce: This is, uh... this is him. This is Will. Uh, you may have seen him on... on the news. Uh...
Hopper: What's wrong with her?
Becky: I told you, you're wasting your time.
[Lucas prepares to go to the gate]
[as he leaves on his bike, he sees the Hawkins Power van]
[the man waves to him and Lucas waves back]
[Mike and Dustin are biking together]
Dustin: This is weird without Lucas.
Mike: He should've shaken my hand.
Dustin: He's just jealous.
Mike: What are you talking about?
Dustin: Sometimes, your total obliviousness just blows my mind. He's your best friend, right?
Mike: Yeah... I mean, I don't know.
Dustin: It's fine. I get it. I didn't get here until the fourth grade. He had the advantage of living next door. But none of that matters. What matters is that he is your best friend. And then this girl shows up and starts living in your basement, and all you ever want to do is pay attention to her.
Mike: That's not true.
Dustin: Yes, it is. And you know it. And he knows it. But no one ever says anything until you both start punching and yelling at each other like goblins with intelligence scores of zero. Now everything's weird.
Mike: He's not my best friend.
Dustin: Yeah, right.
Mike: I mean, he is, but so are you. And so is Will.
Mike: Says who?
Dustin: Says logic.
Mike: Well, I call bull on your logic, because you're my best friend, too.
Dustin: Okay.
[they see the glass around Bradley's]
Mike: Whoa.
[indistinct conversations]
Dustin: You don't think...
Mike: Uh... definitely.
[audience applauding on TV]
TV Host: Are you ready?
[Terry watches TV while Hopper and Joyce talk to Becky at the table]
Becky: She was a part of some study in college.
Hopper: MK Ultra?
Becky: Yeah, that's the one. Was, uh, started in the '50s. By the time Terry got involved, it was supposed to be ramping down, but the drugs just got crazier. Messed her up good. 
Hopper: This was the CIA that ran this?
Becky: You and Terry would've gotten along. "The Man," with a big capital "M." They'd pay... you know, a couple hundred bucks to people like my sister, give 'em drugs, psychedelics. LSD, mostly. And then they'd strip her naked and put her in these isolation tanks.
Joyce: Isolation tanks?
Becky: Yeah. These big bathtubs, basically, filled with salt water, so you can float around in there. You lose any sense of, uh... sense and feel nothing, see nothing. They wanted to expand the boundaries of the mind. Real hippie crap. I... I mean, it's not like they were forcing her to do any of this stuff. The thing is, though, is that she didn't know she was pregnant at the time.
Joyce: Jane. Do you have any pictures of her?
Becky: I don't think you guys understand. Terry miscarried in the third trimester. 
[Becky leads them to the nursery]
Becky: She keeps all of this up. Been doing it for 12 years. Terry, uh, pretends like Jane is real, like she's gonna come home someday.
[lullaby plays from mobile]
Becky: Says she's special. Born with "abilities."
Joyce: Abilities?
Becky: You read any Stephen King? (chuckles) You guys look scared, actually. I mean, it's all make-believe.
Joyce: (clears throat) What... what kind of abilities?
Becky: Telepathy, telekinesis... You know, shit you can do with your mind. That's why the big, bad Man stole Jane away. Her baby's a weapon, off fighting the commies. You know, the doctors all say it's a coping mechanism. You know, to deal with the guilt.
Joyce: Do you think there is any chance she could be telling the truth? About having had the kid.
Becky: There is no birth certificate, nothing from the hospital. Doctors and nurses all confirm that she miscarried.
Hopper: Yeah, but that could've been covered up. Right?
Becky: Like I said, you and Terry would've gotten along.
[Lucas heads up to the laboratory fence]
Lucas: Oh, man.
[he heads along the fence]
[Jonathan looks through supplies]
[clattering]
Jonathan: And I'll have four boxes of the .38s.
Store Owner: What you kids doin' with all this?
Jonathan: Um...
Nancy: Monster hunting.
Store Owner: Huh. 
[cash register dings]
[they carry everything to Jonathan's car]
Jonathan: "Monster hunting"?
Nancy: You know, last week... I was shopping for a new top I thought Steve might like. It took me and Barb all weekend. It seemed like life or death, you know? And... and now-
Jonathan: You're shopping for bear traps with Jonathan Byers.
Nancy: Yeah.
Jonathan: What's the weirdest part? Me or the bear trap?
Nancy: You. It's definitely you.
[car horn honking]
Reed: Hey, Nance! Can't wait to see your movie.
Jonathan: What the hell was that?
Nancy: I don't know.
[Nancy turns around and runs towards the cinema]
Jonathan: What? What? Hey! Where are you going?
[Nancy runs over and looks up at the sign]
[<i>"ALL THE RIGHT MOVES" starring Nancy the slut Wheeler]</i>
Jonathan: Nancy, wait!
[Nancy whimpers]
Jonathan: Nancy!
Man: I can't believe it.
Man 2: These kids!
[Jonathan catches up and looks]
Jonathan: Jesus.
Woman: Wow.
[spray can hissing]
[Nancy runs to the alleyway]
[Tommy laughing]
Jonathan: Wait!
Carol: Tommy, you write like a three-year-old.
Tommy: Shut up!
Nicole: I didn't know you could spell.
[Tommy speaks indistinctly]
[indistinct chatter]
[laughter]
Carol: Aw, hey there, princess!
Tommy: Uh-oh! She looks upset.
[Nancy slaps Steve]
Carol: Oh!
Tommy: Damn!
Nancy: What is wrong with you?
Steve: What's wrong with me? What's wrong with you? I was worried about you. I can't believe that I was actually worried about you. 
Nancy: What are you talking about?
Carol: I wouldn't lie if I were you. You don't want to be known as the lying slut now, do you? 
[Jonathan follows Nancy into the alley]
Tommy: Speak of the devil. Hi.
Nancy: You came by last night?
Carol: Ding! Ding! Ding! Does she get a prize?
Nancy: Look, I don't know what you think you saw but it wasn't like that.
Steve: What, you just let him into your room to... study? 
Tommy: Or for another pervy photo session? 
Nancy: We were just-
Steve: You were just what? Finish that sentence. Finish the sentence. (scoffs) Go to hell, Nancy.
Jonathan: Come on, Nancy, let's just leave.
Steve: You know what, Byers? I'm actually kind of impressed. I always took you for a queer, but I guess you're just a little screw-up like your father. Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah, that house is full of screw-ups. You know, I guess I shouldn't really be surprised. A bunch of screw-ups in your family.
Nancy: Jonathan, leave it.
Steve: I mean, your mom... I'm not even surprised what happened to your brother.
Nancy: Steve, shut up!
Steve: I'm sorry I have to be the one to tell you, but the Byers, their family, it's a disgrace to the entire-
[Jonathan punches Steve in the face]
[Steve groans and tackles Jonathan]
[Jonathan breathing heavily]
Nancy: Steve!
Tommy: Oh!
[both grunting as they fight]
Nancy: Steve. Stop! Steve! Knock it off, you guys!
Carol: Get off of him, seriously!
Tommy: Kick his ass, man!
Carol: Get off! Stop!
[both continue fighting]
Carol: Get in there, he's going to hurt himself!
Tommy: Easy, easy!
Steve: Hey. Hey! Get out of here! Get out of here! Get out of here!
[both grunting and fighting]
Nancy: Jonathan, stop! Stop! You're going to hurt him! Jonathan, stop!
[sirens wailing]
Tommy: Cops!
Nancy: Guys- Jonathan, get off of him! Stop it!
Tommy: Cops! Come on! Stop it! Come on! Cops!
[he tries to stop the fight]
Tommy: You have to stop! Just go, Carol!
Nancy: Stop it! 
[both grunting]
Tommy: Hey, he's had enough, man! I said he's had enough!
Powell: Kids! All right! Stop it!
[indistinct clamoring]
[Jonathan reels back and accidentally hits Callahan]
Callahan: Oh! My nose!
Powell: Calm him down!
[Jonathan grunting as he's arrested]
[Tommy picks up Steve]
Tommy: Go, go, go, go, go, go!
Callahan: Hey! Hey, uh-uh. Uh-uh. Come here, little guys! Come here!
[Callahan runs after Tommy, Nicole, Carol and Steve]
Jonathan: Get off!
[Powell cuffs Jonathan]
Powell: I got this one!
Callahan: Get back here! Get back here, you little punks!
[Nancy breathing heavily]
[audience cheering on TV]
TV Host: Good gift for a college student...
[TV continues indistinctly]
Hopper: Well, thank you for your time. We appreciate it.
[Joyce looks at Terry who's watching TV]
Becky: Hmm, yeah, I'm sorry I couldn't be of more help.
[door opens]
Becky: Good luck.
Hopper: Thank you.
[they head back to the car and get in]
Hopper: Hey...
Joyce: What?
Hopper: We're gonna find him.
Joyce: Yeah, like Terry found her daughter? 
Hopper: We're close.
Joyce: Twelve years? Twelve years she's been looking for her-
Hopper: And then she shows up at Benny's five nights ago, which means we've got a chance. You know what I would give? For a chance? You know what I would give?
[Callahan is heard over the radio]
Callahan: Hey, Chief, you there? Hey, Chief?
[Hopper picks up the radio]
Hopper: Yeah, go ahead.
Callahan: Yeah, a fight broke out here and
Hopper: Cal, I don't have time for this.
Callahan: It's Jonathan Byers. You haven't seen Joyce, have you?
[Flo opens the freezer and gets out some ice]
Nancy: Do you think we'll be out of here soon?
Flo: You, yes. Him, no. He assaulted a police officer.
[ice cubes clatter]
Nancy: Well, how long are you gonna keep him?
Jonathan: You and your boyfriend have big plans, do you?
Nancy: He's not my boyfriend.
Flo: I think you better tell him that.
Nancy: What?
Flo: Only love makes you that crazy, sweetheart. And that damn stupid. 
[Flo hands Nancy the towel full of ice]
[Nancy walks over to Jonathan who's cuffed to the desk]
Nancy: Found some ice.
Jonathan: Thanks. 
[Nancy puts the towel to his head and holds it there for him]
Jonathan: Everything okay?
Nancy: Yeah. Everything's fine. 
[Eleven is sat eating Eggos]
[Dustin and Mike shout in the distance]
Dustin: El!
Mike: Eleven! Eleven! El!
Dustin: El! Eleven!
Mike: Hey, stop. Do you hear that?
Dustin: What?
Mike: El! El?
[Troy and James appear and come closer to the kids]
Troy: Hey, there, Frogface. Toothless.
[Troy shows his knife]
[Dustin drops his bike]
Dustin: Shit! Run, Mike!
Mike: What?
Dustin: Run! Come on!
Troy: You're dead, Wheeler.
Dustin: Move, Mike! Mike, come on, run!
[Troy and James chase Mike and Dustin]
[cuts to Lucas still following the fence] 
[Lucas checks his compass and climbs a tree to check what's inside the fence]
[he looks around and sees an army truck arriving before seeing the Hawkins Power vans]
[Mike and Dustin keep running, panting]
[Dustin groans]
Dustin: Cramp!
Mike: Just keep going! Keep going!
[Troy starts catching up to Dustin]
[James appears coming from the other direction]
Dustin: Shit!
[Dustin and Mike stop, cornered]
[Mike picks up a rock, Dustin picks up a stick]
Mike: Stay back! Don't come any closer!
[Mike throws the rock, missing by a long shot]
[James scoffs]
James: Nice throw, numbnuts.
[Dustin tries hit Troy with the stick, yelling]
[Troy grabs him and aims the knife at him]
Dustin: Get off! Get off me!
Mike: Let him go! Let him go!
Troy: Stay back, or I cut him! 
Mike: What do you want?
Troy: I want to know how you did it!
Mike: How I did what?
[Dustin whimpers]
Troy: I know you did something to me. Some nerdy science shit to make me do that.
Mike: You mean piss your pants?
Dustin: Our friend has superpowers, and she squeezed your tiny bladder with her mind.
Troy: Shut up! I think I should save Toothless here a trip to the dentist. Help him lose the rest of his baby teeth.
Mike: Let him go. Let him go!
Troy: I'll let him go, sure. But first... it's your turn.
Mike: My turn for what?
Troy: Wet yourself.
Mike: What?
Troy: Jump... or Toothless here gets an early trip to the dentist.
Dustin: Stop! No!
Troy: I'll cut him right now!
[Dustin whimpering as Troy aims the knife closer to his mouth]
Mike: All right, just hold on! Hold on!
Dustin: Mike, don't do it. I don't need my baby teeth, Mike! Mike, seriously, don't!
[Mike walks over to the edge and looks at the water below]
Dustin: Mike, don't do it! Seriously, don't do it, man! Seriously, don't!
[Mike stands on the edge]
Dustin: Mike, don't!
Troy: Dentist's office opens in five... Four! Three! Two!
Dustin: Mike!
Troy: One!
[Mike jumps and screams]
[Troy, Dustin and James run to the edge] 
Dustin: Holy shit.
[Mike gasping, floating]
[he suddenly rises up back to safety]
Mike: Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!
[he grunts as he lands]
[they look over and see an angry Eleven walking over] 
[she sends James flying backwards as she gets closer] 
[one of Troy's bones cracks after Eleven tilts her head]
[Troy screams]
Troy: She broke my arm! My arm!
Eleven: Go.
Troy: Let's get out of here! Let's go!
James: Go!
[Troy and James run off]
Dustin: Yeah, that's right! You better run! She's our friend and she's crazy! You come back here and she'll kill you! You hear me? She'll kill you, you sons of bitches! She'll kill you, you hear me?
[Eleven almost faints]
[ticking]
[Eleven breathing heavily]
[water trickling]
