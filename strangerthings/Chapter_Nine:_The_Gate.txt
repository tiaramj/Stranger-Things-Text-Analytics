Script: 
Mike: Eleven. 
Eleven: Mike. [gasps] 
[they embrace]
[after El and Mike’s hug is over]
Eleven: 353 days. I heard.
Eleven: Where have you been? [they have a moment and hug]
Hopper: Hey! Let's talk. Alone.
[they leave the room and go to another room to talk]
Mike: Protecting her! Protecting her? 
Mike: So I should be thanking you? 
Mike: I don't! I don't understand! 
Mike: I don't blame her! I blame you! I blame you!
Hopper: That's okay, kid. That's okay. 
Hopper: Oh, jeez- 
Hopper: Okay. All right! Stop it. 
Mike: Liar! Liar! Liar! 
Mike: [crying] Liar! Liar!
Lucas: We missed you. 
Eleven: I missed you, too. 
Dustin: We talked about you pretty much every day. 
Eleven: [puts her thumb in his mouth] Teeth. 
Dustin: What? 
Eleven: You have teeth. 
Dustin: Oh. You like these pearls? [purrs] 
[no one liked that]
Max: Eleven? Hey. Um, I'm Max. I've heard a lot about you.
Joyce: [sighs] Hey. Hey, sweetheart. [they hug]
Eleven: [cries] 
Joyce: [sniffles] Hey.
Eleven: Can I see him?
[Eleven kneels by the bed and looks at him]
Joyce: He's not doing well. 
Eleven: I know. I saw. 
Joyce: What else did you see?
Joyce: You opened this gate before, right? 
Eleven: Yes. 
[there are hundreds - near thousands - of demo-dogs - they screech]
[Karen is enjoying a relaxing bubble bath - reading a romance novel and all that stuff but the doorbell rings and her peace is disturbed]
[doorbell rings] 
[doorbell rings] 
Karen: Ted! Would you please get that? 
[cut to Ted sleeping]
[snoring] 
[doorbell continues ringing] 
[doorbell continues ringing]
[cut back to Karen]
Karen: Ted! 
[doorbell ringing rapidly] 
Karen: Hold on, please. 
Karen: Oh. Hi. 
Billy: Hi. I, uh, didn't realize Nancy had a sister. 
Karen: [chuckles] 
Billy: What's so funny? 
Karen: I'm Nancy's mother. 
Billy: No. 
Karen: Yes. [chuckles] 
Billy: Mrs. Wheeler. 
Karen: [stammers] Um, I'm sorry, and you are? 
Karen: You must be here for Nancy. 
Karen: Oh. 
Billy: Always. 
Billy: You're a real lifesaver, you know that? 
Karen: Anytime. 
Dustin: Demo-dogs. 
Hopper: [sighs] I'm sorry, what? 
Hopper: How is this important right now? 
Dustin: It's not. I'm sorry.
Eleven: I can do it.
Hopper: You're not hearing me. 
Eleven: I'm hearing you. I can do it.
Mike: Even if El can, there's still another problem. If the brain dies, the body dies. 
Max: I thought that was the whole point.
Lucas: Will's a part of that army. 
Mike: Closing the gate will kill him. 
Joyce: He likes it cold.
Hopper: What? 
Nancy: If this is a virus, and Will's the host, then... 
Jonathan: Then we need to make the host uninhabitable. 
Nancy: So if he likes it cold... 
Joyce: We need to burn it out of him. 
Mike: We have to do it somewhere he doesn't know this time. 
Dustin: Yeah, somewhere far away. 
Steve: You should go with him. 
Nancy: What? 
Steve: With Jonathan. 
Nancy: No, I'm... [scoffs] I'm not just gonna leave Mike. 
Nancy: Steve... 
Steve: It's okay, Nance. It's okay. 
[cut to Mike and Eleven outside]
Mike: Just be careful, okay? I can't lose you again. 
Eleven: You won't lose me. 
Mike: Do you promise?
Hopper: El... Come on, let's go. It's time.
Eleven: [sighs deeply] 
Mike: Okay. 
[Eleven gets in Hopper’s truck - engine starts]
Hopper: So, what, we're just not gonna talk about it, huh? 
Eleven: About what? 
Eleven: To see Mama. 
Hopper: Okay. How'd you get there? 
Eleven: A truck. 
Hopper: A truck?
Eleven: A big truck. 
Hopper: A big truck? Whose truck was it? 
Eleven: A man's. 
Hopper: A man's? 
Eleven: A nice man. [Hopper has a surprised Pikachu face]
Eleven: I... I shouldn't have left. 
Eleven: A black hole?
Eleven: Who's Sarah? 
Hopper: Sarah? Sarah's my girl. She's my little girl. 
Eleven: Where is she? 
Eleven: Gone. 
Eleven: Stupid? 
Hopper: [chuckling] Yeah. Stupid. 
Eleven: [chuckles] 
Hopper: Just really stupid. 
Eleven: [she takes his hand] I've been stupid, too. 
Eleven: Bitchin'.
Hopper: Okay. Sure. Bitchin'. 
Eleven: [chuckles and sniffles] 
[monster roaring in distance]
[emptying everything out of Joyce’s fridge]
Dustin: All right. [sighs] It should fit now. 
Steve: Is this really necessary? 
Dustin: What am I supposed to do? 
Steve: Get the door, man. 
Dustin: All right, I got the door. 
Lucas: Mike, would you just stop already? 
Dustin: Demo-dogs!
Lucas: The chief will take care of her. 
Max: Like she needs protection. 
Lucas: If we get their attention... 
Max: Maybe we can draw them from the lab.
Mike: Clear a path to the gate. 
Steve: Yeah, and then we all die.
Dustin: That's one point of view.
Steve: No, that's not a point of view, man. That's a fact.
Steve: Oh, yeah? That's a no. 
Dustin: The mind flayer would call away his army. 
Lucas: They'd all come to stop us. 
Mike: We circle back to the exit. 
Steve: Guys. 
Mike: By the time they realize we're gone-
Max: El would be at the gate. 
Mike: But-
Mike: This isn't a stupid sports game.
[engine revving] 
[rock music playing on car radio] 
[cut to Billy pulling up outside the house]
[tires screech] 
[music stops playing – he gets out and looks at the porch]
Billy: Am I dreaming, or is that you, Harrington? 
Steve: Yeah, it's me. Don't cream your pants. 
[car door slams] 
Billy: What are you doing here, amigo?
Steve: I could ask you the same thing. Amigo. 
Steve: Huh, that's weird. I don't know her. 
Billy: Small? Redhead? Bit of a bitch. 
Steve: Doesn't ring a bell. Sorry, buddy.
Steve: Oh, yeah? Why's that?

[Billy smashes the plate over Steve’s head] 
Lucas: Steve! 
Max: Billy! 
Mike: Holy shit! 
Dustin: Shit! 
[Billy hits Steve HARD - Steve groans] 
Steve: [groans and falls to the ground] 
Billy: Whoo! Get up!

Max: Let's get out of here.
[Jonathan puts Will down on the couch and Nancy looks around]
Nancy: It's actually kinda nice. 
Joyce: We'll do it here. 
Jonathan: Are you sure this is a good idea? 
[Nancy lights the fire and Jonathan turns on the heaters]
[Hopper pulls up outside, he and Eleven get out]
[monsters growling can be heard from inside]
[Eleven has a momentary flashback of being in the lab]
[Hopper gets what he needs from the trunk and slams in shut - snapping Eleven out of her daze - he has a shotgun]

Dustin: Just relax. She's driven before. 
Mike: Yeah, in a parking lot. 
Lucas: That counts. 
Dustin: They were gonna leave you behind. 
Steve: Oh, my God. [having a minor freak out] 
Dustin: I promised that you'd be cool, okay? 
Mike: I told you he'd freak out. 
Steve: Stop the car! 
Max: Everybody shut up! I'm trying to focus! 
Lucas: Oh, wait, that's Mount Sinai. Make a left. 
Max: What? 
Lucas: Make a left. 
[tires screeching]

[Everyone is sweating up a storm]
[Will wakes up and begins struggling]
