Script: 
[line ringing]
[creaking]
[Joyce is on the phone]
Hopper: Hey, you reached Jim. I'm probably doing something incredible right now, and I can't-
[Joyce sighs and adds more pictures to the jigsaw of drawings]
[in his room, Will talks with Mike]
Will: It's like... It's like I feel what the shadow monster's feeling. See what he's seeing.
Mike: Like in the Upside Down?
Will: Some of him is there. But some of him is here, too. 
Mike: Here, like, in this house?
Will: In this house and... in me. It's like... It's like he's reaching into Hawkins more and more. And the more he spreads, the more connected to him I feel.
Mike: And the more you see these now-memories.
Will: At first I just felt it in the back of my head. I didn't even really know it was there. It's like when you have a dream and you can't remember it unless you think really hard. It was like that. But know it's like... Now I remember. I remember all the time.
Mike: Maybe... Maybe that's good.
Will: Good?
Mike: Just think about it, Will. You're like a spy now. A superspy. Spying on the shadow monster. If you know what he's seeing and feeling... maybe that's how we can stop him. Maybe all of this is happening for a reason.
Will: You really think so?
Mike: Yeah. Yeah, I really do. 
[the boys look at the original drawing of the shadow in the Upside Down]
Will: What if he figures out we're spying on him? [sniffles] What if he spies back?
Mike: He won't.
Will: How do you know?
Mike: We won't let him.
[Hopper looks through the tunnels]
[Hopper breathing heavily]
[screeching]
Hopper: Ugh!
[breathing heavily]
[screeching]
[Hopper continues breathing heavily]
[he looks up and sees a creature on the ceiling]
[hissing]
[the creature spits at him]
[Hopper coughing]
[he falls back and lands next to another creature that spits at him]
[Hopper continues coughing]
Hopper: Ugh! 
[he tries to get back to where he came in, grunting and coughing]
[Hopper collapses as the tunnel starts repairing itself]
[Jonathan drives into the parking lot]
Man 1: Hey.
Man 2: Hey. Did you get 'em?
Man 1: Yeah.
[both continue speaking indistinctly]
[Jonathan heads inside with Nancy]
[song playing on stereo]
[Nancy rings the bell]
Nancy: We'd like a... uh, a room.
Owner: We got those. You want a single or a double?
Nancy and Jonathan: Double.
[the owner looks at Jonathan, slurping on her Hardee's drink]
[they get a key and head to their room]
[they get in their beds]
Jonathan: Nance... Uh, on or off?
Nancy: Hmm.
Jonathan: What?
Nancy: Nothing. Just... déjà vu. [chuckles softly]
Jonathan: Yeah.
[both chuckle softly]
Nancy: Don't you think it's weird?
Jonathan: What?
Nancy: How we only seem to hang out when the world's about to end?
Jonathan: It's not going to end.
Nancy: Feels like it. [sighs]
[Nancy puts her hand with the cut on the bedside table]
Nancy: Still have yours?
[Jonathan puts his cut hand beside hers]
Jonathan: Yeah.
Nancy: Mmm... Yeah, mine's bigger.
Jonathan: [chuckles] Congratulations.
Nancy: Thanks.
[they pull away and tuck themselves into bed]
[Jonathan sighs]
Nancy: What happened?
Jonathan: What do you mean? 
Nancy: To us? After everything, you just... disappeared.
Jonathan: [sighs] Yeah, Will needed me. And Steve...
Nancy: I waited.
Jonathan: Yeah, like, only a month.
[Nancy turns away from him]
Nancy: I want them off.
[Jonathan turns the lights off and turns away from her]
[Will sits up, gasping]
Mike: Will, what's wrong?
[Will leaves his room with Mike and goes over to Joyce, who is sat looking at the drawings]
Will: Mom? Mom? Mom?
Joyce: [gasps] Yeah?
Will: I saw him.
Joyce: You saw who, baby?
Will: Hopper. I think he's in trouble. I think he's going to die.
[Hopper wakes up, gasping]
[he grunts as he gets up]
[retches and spits out a black slime]
[grunting as he stands up]
[Hopper grabs his hat and torch and searches for the exit, panting]
[he finds a dead end]
Hopper: Shit!
[he cuts off the sleeve of his jacket and turns it into a mask]
[he gets out a pack of cigarettes and drops one to start a trail]
[song playing on stereo]
[Erica puts loads of syrup on her breakfast]
Mrs. Sinclair: That's enough, Erica.
Erica: Uh-uh.
Lucas: Dad?
Mr. Sinclair: Mmm-hmm?
Lucas: When Mom's mad at you, how do you make her not mad?
Mrs. Sinclair: Hmm. That's a great question. How do you, hon?
Mr. Sinclair: First, I apologize. Then, I get your mother whatever she wants.
Lucas: Even when she's wrong?
Mr. Sinclair: She's never wrong, son.
Mrs. Sinclair: That's right. [chuckles]
[Lucas gets up and takes his plate to the kitchen]
Mrs. Sinclair: Not hungry?
Lucas: Not really.
Mrs. Sinclair: Where you goin'?
Lucas: To hang out with Dustin.
[Erica puts more syrup on her breakfast
[Mrs. Sinclair gives her a look]
Erica; [softly] Sorry.
[Lucas grabs his bike and bikes away]
[Lucas bikes past Claudia looking for Mews]
Claudia: Mews! Mewsy! Mews! Mewsy!
[Claudia goes back inside, Dustin is on the phone]
Claudia: Dusty, baby, you're sure she's not in your room? [sighs]
Dustin: Uh-huh.
Automated voice: If you'd like to make a call...
Dustin: Thank you so much, Mr. McCorkle. Thank you so much. You are a true lifesaver. All right, this was great.
[dial tone]
Dustin: Thank you. All right. Have a good one. Bye-bye, now. All right. You, too. [puts the phone down] All right, great news.
Claudia: They found her?
Dustin: No. But they saw her wandering around Loch Nora.
Claudia: [crying] How did the poor baby get all the way out there?
Dustin: I don't know. Lost, I guess. But they're gonna look for her. And I'll stay here, just in case they call again. And you're gonna go help look? Yeah? Yeah? Give me hug. G [he hugs her]ive me a hug. Go get her. You're gonna find her.
Claudia: Okay.
Dustin: We can find her.
Claudia: We can find her.
Dustin: I love you.
[Claudia starts leaving]
Claudia: I love you.
Dustin: I love you.
Claudia: I love you.
Dustin: All right, go. All right.
[Claudia leaves]
[Dustin dresses himself in hockey gear and sets up a trail of baloney]
Dustin: All right, Dart. Breakfast time.
[he opens the door and runs]
Dustin: Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Shit. Shit. Shit. Shit. Shit. Shit. Shit. Shit. Shit. Shit. Shit. Shit. Shit. Shit. Shit. Shit. Shit.
[Dustin runs to a shed in the garden]
[Dustin panting]
Dustin: Come on. Come on, I know you're hungry. [he spots Dart following the baloney trail] Yes. Yes, yes, yes.
[Dart growling]
Dustin: Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes.
[Dustin panting]
Dustin: Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes.
[Dart growls and looks at Dustin before stepping into the basement]
Dustin: Shit!
[Dustin backs up, breathing heavily]
[chittering]
[Dustin bursts out of the shed, yelling]
[Dart gets whacked into the basement, screeching]
[Dustin yelling]
[Dart growling]
[Dustin closes the basement, grunting]
Dustin: I'm sorry. You ate my cat.
[Dart screeching]
[brakes squealing]
Trucker: All right. I think this is it. Five-one-five Larrabee, right?
[song playing on stereo]
Eleven: Yes. Five-fifteen.
Trucker: All right, "Five-fifteen." Sure.
Eleven: Thank you.
[Eleven climbs out of the truck]
Trucker: Hey. You apologize to your mama, yeah? Huh? Must be scared half to death. How long's it been?
Eleven: Long time.
[the truck drives off]
[Eleven walks up the road to the house]
[Eleven breathing heavily]
[she sighs and knocks on the door]
Becky: Go away! I'm not interested!
[Eleven knocks more]
Becky: [opens the door slightly] Look, I don't want your Thin Mints, all right, kid?
Eleven: Thin Mints?
Becky: Or your religious mumbo jumbo. Whatever you're selling, I ain't buying, okay?
[Becky closes the door]
[Eleven unlocks the door and opens it, the door creaking]
Eleven: I want to see Mama.
[Becky leads Eleven to Terry, who's watching TV]
Host: Name a way you occupy your time when you're having a boring day at work.
[buzzer rings]
Man: Drink coffee.
Host: "Drink coffee," said Mike.
[bell dings]
Host: Yeah! Five answers will beat it, Lynn.
Lynn: Visit with other employees.
Host: "Visit with other employees."
Terry: Rainbow.
[bell dings]
[applause]
Terry: Three to the right. Four to the left.
Eleven: Mama?
[Eleven walks over to Terry]
Terry: Breathe. Sunflower. Rainbow. Three to the right. Four to the left.
Eleven: Mama, can you hear me?
Terry: Four-fifty. Breathe. Sunflower. Rainbow.
[Eleven kneels in front of Terry]
Eleven: Mama? It's me... Jane. [puts her hand on Terry's] I'm here now.
[Terry looks at her]
Terry: Breathe. Sunflower. Rainbow. Four-fifty. Breathe. Sunflower.
Eleven: What's wrong with Mama?
Terry: Rainbow. Four-fifty.
[Becky starts crying]
[Jonathan parks outside]
[rock song playing on stereo]
[song stops]
Jonathan: Are you positive this is the right place?
Nancy: "3833." Yeah.
Jonathan: All right.
[they get out and head to the door]
[train horn blaring in the distance]
[doorbell buzzes]
Murray: Look at the camera. The camera.
Jonathan: What camera?
Murray: Not the loudspeaker. Above you, to the right.
[door rattles and opens]
Murray: Nancy Wheeler. Jonathan Byers. You two are a long way from home.
[he lets them in and looks around cautiously before closing the door]
[Murray walks them into his living room]
Murray: Well... I hope you didn't come all this way to tell me about the bear in the Harrington kid's backyard. I've heard that one already.
[he shows them his work room]
Murray: Take a look. Go ahead, don't be shy. I followed up on 200 tips, most bogus, but that's how these things always go, okay? I know every last step Barbara took that day, every last person she talked to. The answer to what happened to your friend, it's up here somewhere. I assure you that. I just gotta connect the right dots.
Nancy: Timeline's wrong.
Murray: I'm sorry?
Nancy: Your timeline is wrong. And the girl with the buzzed hair, she's not Russian. She's from Hawkins Lab. Her name was Eleven.
Jonathan: You might wanna sit down for this.
[Billy pulls up and parks]
[rock song playing on stereo]
[engine revving]
Billy: If you're not out in an hour-
Max: Walking home. Yeah, yeah, I know.
Billy: Hey! Watch the attitude, shitbird.
[Max heads inside]
[tires screeching]
[indistinct chatter]
[video games beeping]
[Max walks up to Dig Dug which has an out of order sign on it]
Keith: Sorry about that, Road Warrior.
Max: What happened?
Keith: Short circuit in the motherboard. A real bummer. But fret not. I got another machine up and running in the back.
[he leads her to the employee's only area]
Keith; Hold these.
[Max holds his Cheetos as he opens the door]
[Max sees Lucas in there and sighs, walking in]
Keith: You better get me that date now, Sinclair.
Lucas: I told you I would.
Keith: [grunts] And keep things PG in here, all right?
[door closes]
Max: What is this shit, stalker?
Lucas: Sorry. I just needed a safe place.
Max: A safe place to what? Be creepy?
Lucas: Listen. I'm gonna tell you the truth about everything that happened last year. But if anyone finds out, you could be arrested. [sighs] Possibly killed.
Max: Killed?
Lucas: I need to know. Do you accept the risk?
Max: Oh, my God! This... this is so stupid.
Lucas: Do you accept the risk?
Max: Yeah. Sure. Fine. I accept the risk. Let's hear it.
Lucas: Last year... Will didn't get lost in the woods. He got lost somewhere else.
[Will is drawing an intersection of tunnels]
Joyce: Hey, is this where you saw him? [stutters] Is this where you saw Hopper?
Will: I think so. Yeah.
Joyce: [softly] Okay.
[Mike and Joyce try to find the matching image]
Mike: Here!
[Joyce runs over and checks]
Joyce: Okay, so... so Hopper is here?
Mike; Yeah. Now we just need to find out where here is, right?
Joyce: Right.
Mike: Did he say anything? I mean, before he left?
Joyce: [sighs] Uh, some... something about vines?
[car approaching]
Joyce: Hopper.
[they run to the door and see Bob on the other side of it]
Bob: Surprise. I would've called, but you said not to clog up the line.
Joyce: You know, I... We're fine, we don't need anything.
Bob: When I was sick as a kid, and I was sick all the time as a kid, nothing made me feel better than focusing on these brain teasers.
Joyce: Those are great. Ah...
Bob: I could teach him how to play.
Joyce: You know, he's sleeping.
[thunder rumbling]
Bob: Okay. I could wait with you?
Joyce: [sighs] Listen, it's just not a good time. But, um, you know what? I'll call you, okay? Thank you.
Bob: You sure?
Joyce: Yeah.
Bob: Well, have him call me. They don't call me Bob the Brain for nothing. [chuckles and heads to his car]
Joyce: [gasps] Bob!
Bob: That's my name.
[she brings him in under the pretence that he has to solve a riddle] 
Bob: Huh. Hmm. You drew all these yourself? [looks at Will]
Joyce: Mmm-hmm.
Bob: Why, exactly?
Joyce: I... I told you the rules. No questions, okay?
Bob: Yeah.
Joyce: We... we just need you to help us figure out what... Bob? Bob? Over here. Where... where this is. That's the objective. Find the X.
Bob: Yeah? What's at the X? Pirate treasure? [chuckles]
Joyce: Bob, no questions.
Bob: Okay. [sighs and clicks tongue]
[Joyce clears throat]
Bob: Let me talk to you for a second. Hang on, guys.
[he pulls her into another room]
Bob: Joyce, you can talk to me. You know that, right?
Joyce: [stammers] Yeah. What's the problem, exactly?
Bob: What's the problem? Joyce, [sighs] Will doesn't look well. You don't look well. What's going on?
Joyce: Nothing. Nothing.
Bob: Is this an episode? Is this one of Will's episodes?
Joyce: No. No! No. [scoffs]
Bob: [stutters] I'm sorry. I just... I don't... see how any of this is good for Will, or for you. And even if I wanted to play along, I mean, how could I figure anything out if I don't understand the context of the game?
[thunder rumbling]
Bob: Or...
[Bob walks over to a heart shape in the drawings]
Joyce: What? What is it?
Bob: I know that shape. It's Lovers' Lake. It's Lovers' Lake. I get it. Okay, I get it. That's Lake Jordan. And if that's Lake Jordan, then you can probably find... Yeah, that's, uh, Sattler's quarry. And if you just follow it naturally... it moves to... the Eno River. And there it is. That's the Eno, do you see it? Okay, so the lines aren't roads. But they act like roads. And they act like roads 'cause when you follow 'em, you'll see... they don't go over water. And that's the giveaway. That's the giveaway. Ha! Don't you get it? It's not a puzzle, it's a map. It's a map of Hawkins. [laughs] Right, Will?
[Hopper squishes a tendril under his foot]
[squealing]
[radio static]
Hopper: Does anybody copy? Look, if anybody copies, this is Jim Hopper, Hawkins' Chief...
[radio static]
[Hopper panting as he looks around and sees bones and dying animals]
[Hopper gasps]
[breathing heavily, he gets out a lighter]
[tendrils screech when the lighter gets close to them]
[Hopper grunts and makes a torch out of his jacket and a bone]
[the tendrils move away from the heat, screeching]
[Hopper tries to push through the walls, grunting]
[Dustin buries Mews]
Dustin: Guys, this is Dustin again. Does anyone copy? This is a code red. I repeat, a code red! I really need someone to pick up here. Hopper's MIA, and I've got a code red. Code red! All right, it's Dustin again. Seriously, I have a code red.
[in the Sinclair House, Erica picks up Lucas' radio]
Erica: Could you please shut up?
Dustin: Erica? Erica, is Lucas there? Where is he?
Erica: Don’t know. Don't care.
Dustin: [stutters] Is he with Mike?
Erica: Like I said, I don't know and I don't care.
Dustin: Please tell him it's super important. Please tell him that I have a code-
Erica: Code red?
Dustin: Yep, code red. Exactly.
Erica: Mmm-hmm. I got a code for you instead. It's called code shut-your-mouth.
[radio static]
Dustin: [stutters] Erica?
Becky: I just need a little help understanding, sweetie, okay? Can you tell me where you came from? Where you've been all this time?
[TV playing indistinctly]
Becky: A policeman and a woman came looking for you last year. Did they find you?
Eleven: She won't get better... will she?
Becky: They don't think so, no. [sniffles] But she's not in any pain. She's just stuck, they think. Like in a dream. A long dream.
Eleven: A good dream?
Becky: I hope so.
[Eleven sighs]
Eleven: Is it the same dream?
Becky: We don't know. Sometimes she says different words. But usually those. [cries softly] She always believed that you were out there. She always believed that you'd come home one day.
Eleven: Home?
Becky: Yeah, home.
[Becky shows her the nursery]
[Eleven sniffles]
[door creaking]
Eleven: Pretty.
I can get you a real bed, and you can stay here with me if you want. How's that sound? I wanna help you, but to really do that, I need you to talk to me, okay? Doesn't have to be now. Doesn't have to be today. But when you're ready. Okay?
Eleven: Okay.
[Eleven sees the corridor light flickering]
[Eleven follows the flickering lights]
Becky: Sweetie, really, it's just the wiring. 
Eleven: No.
[muttering indistinctly]
Eleven: It's Mama.
[Eleven wipes the blood from Terry's nose]
Terry: Sunflower. Rainbow. Three to the right. Four to the left.
Becky: [stutters] I don't understand.
Terry: Four-fifty.
Eleven: She knows I'm here.
[TV channels changing]
Eleven: She wants to talk.
Terry: Rainbow.
[static hissing]
[Terry speaking indistinctly]
Bob: All right. All right. I'm 3.6 inches, what do you got?
Mike: I'm not sure. Mrs. Byers?
Joyce: Hold on. Twenty-one feet, four inches.
Bob: What about Tippecanoe to Danford Creek?
Joyce: [sighs and stammers] Danford? Where's Danford?
Will: Dining room.
Joyce: [sighs] Sixteen feet, ten inches.
Bob: What about Danford to Jordan?
Bob: It's not. It's... it's really not.
Joyce: Okay. Can't you figure it out?
Bob: [stuttering] Well, it's hard. The ratio isn't exactly one-to-one. I mean, if you're twisting my arm, and you are twisting my arm, I would say that the X is... maybe a half mile southeast of Danford?
Joyce: [sighs] Thank you. Thank you.
[she grabs the map and runs off, followed by Will and Mike]
Bob: What? Are we... we really going?
[Bob gets up and follows them]
[Dustin bikes towards the Wheeler house]
[he dumps his bike and runs to the door]
[Karen is living her best life: on the phone with a big glass of wine]
Karen: I don't know, Cath. Maybe if it was Margaret Thatcher, that'd be another story.
[doorbell ringing]
Karen: Just a second, Cath. Ted, can you get that please? Sorry.
[Ted gets up slowly]
Ted: I got it.
[he opens the door and sees Dustin]
Dustin: Your line has been busy for over two hours, Mr. Wheeler. Do you realize this?
Ted: Oh, I do realize.
Dustin: Is Mike home?
Ted: No.
Dustin: No? Well, where the hell is he?
Ted: Karen, where's our son?
Karen: Will's!
Ted: Will's.
Dustin: [sighs] No one's picking up there. Nancy. What about Nancy?
Ted: Karen, where's Nancy?
Karen: [sighs] Ally's.
Ted: Ally's. Our children don't live here anymore. You didn't know that?
Dustin: Seriously?
Ted: Am I done here?
Dustin: Son of a bitch. You're really no help at all, you know that?
Ted: Hey! Language.
[Dustin walks back to his bike and sees Steve pull up in his car]
[Steve gets out with flowers, talking to himself as he walks to the door]
Steve: Listen... I've been thinking... I love you. I'm sorry. I'm sorry? What the hell am I sorry for?
Dustin: Steve.  Are those for Mr. or Mrs. Wheeler?
Steve: No.
Dustin: Good.
[Dustin grabs them and walks to Steve's car]
Steve: Hey. What the hell? Hey!
Dustin: Nancy isn't home.
Steve: Where is she?
Dustin: Doesn't matter. We have bigger problems than your love life. Do you still have that bat?
Steve: Bat? What bat?
Dustin: The one with the nails?
Steve: Why?
Dustin: I'll explain it on the way.
[Dustin gets in Steve's car]
Steve: Now?
Dustin: Now!
[Steve runs to his car and drives]
[Hopper is still climbing up through the wall, grunting]
[he hasn't gotten very far but is still panting]
[he groans and sits down]
[coughing]
[he grabs a cigarette, breathing heavily]
[Hopper groans as a tendril wraps itself around his leg]
Hopper: Son of a bitch!
[he grabs his knife and stands up, grunting]
[the tendrils grab his neck and pull him off his feet, Hopper yelling]
Hopper: Wait. Wait. No, no! No! No!
[he tries to grab his knife as more tendrils wrap around him, grunting]
[Hopper yelling]
[muffled screaming]
Lucas: And that was the last we ever saw of her. After that, she was just gone. I can't believe it's been that long. Feels like yesterday.
Max: Yeah. I mean, I bet. Wow.
Lucas: It's crazy. [sighs] I know.
Max: It's crazy, but... I really liked it.
Lucas: Liked it?
Max: Yeah. Well, I mean, I had a few issues.
Lucas: Issues?
Max: I felt it was a little derivative in parts.
Lucas: What are you talking about?
Max: I just wish it had a little more originality. That's all.
Lucas: You don't believe me?
Max: Lucas, come on, seriously How gullible do you think I am?
Lucas: Why would I make this up?
Max: I don't know. To impress me or something? Or you're just, like, insane.
Lucas: I tell you all of this. I mean, top-secret stuff. Risking my life. And this is how you react?
Max: [chuckles] Risking your life?
Lucas: Oh, so this is funny to you?
Max: Yeah. I mean... kind of funny. Stupid, but funny.
[Max starts to leave]
Lucas: Where are you going?
Max: Story time's over, isn't it?
[indistinct chatter as they leave the staff room]
Lucas; What's wrong with you? I gave you what you wanted.
Max: I wanted to be a part of the group, not a part of some joke.
Lucas: It's not a joke.
Max: You did a good job, okay? You can go tell the others I believed your lies if it gets you experience points or whatever.
Lucas: [sighs] We have a lot of rules in our party, but the most important is, "Friends don't lie." Never ever. No matter what.
Max: Is that right? Then how do you explain this?
[she takes off the out of order sign from Dig Dug and sticks it to him]
Lucas: [sighs] I had to do that. To protect you.
Max: To protect me from who, exactly? The big bad government baddies from Hawkins Lab?
Lucas: Lower your voice.
Max: Maybe it was to protect me from the Demogorgon from another dimension?
Lucas: Max, I'm serious, shut up!
Max: Oh, no, no! You know what it was? It was Eleven. The girl-
[Lucas covers her mouth]
Lucas: Stop talking.  You're going to get us killed. Do you understand?
Max: You're serious?
Lucas: I really wish I wasn't.
Max: Prove it.
Lucas: I can't.
Max: So what? I'm supposed to just trust you?
Lucas: Yes.
[car engine revving]
[tires screeching]
Max: Shit. I gotta go. Um... [holds Lucas' hand] Don't follow me out. Okay?
Lucas: Do you believe me?
[Max goes outside to Billy's car]
[Billy sees Lucas in the doorway as the door closes]
[rock song playing on stereo]
Billy: The hell I tell you?
Max: I'm not late.
Billy: You know what I'm talking about.
Max: Oh, Lucas?
Billy: [scoffs] So he has a name now, huh?
Max: [stammers] It's a small town, okay? We weren't hanging out.
Billy: Hmm. Well, you know what happens when you lie.
Max: I'm not lying.
[Billy gives her a look and starts driving]
[Lucas heads out and looks at the car, Max looks back at him]
Owens on tape: What if they try to replicate that? The more attention we bring to ourselves, the more people like the Hollands who know the truth, the more likely that scenario becomes. You see why I have to stop the truth from spreading, too. Just the same as those weeds there. By whatever means necessary.
[tape recorder clicks]
Nancy: So, is it enough? The tape recording, is it enough? [stutters] Is it incriminating?
[Murray gets up and leaves the room]
[Murray starts making himself a cocktail]
[liquid pouring]
Nancy: What are you doing?
Murray: Thinking.
Nancy: With vodka?
Murray: It's a central nervous system depressant. So yes, with vodka.
[he puts on a record]
Nancy: Music? Really?
Murray: Yes. It helps me...
Jonathan: What? Think?
[Murray sighs heavily]
[jazz song playing]
Nancy: How long is this gonna take?
Murray: Longer if you keep talking.
Nancy: Is the tape incriminating or not? It's a simple question.
Murray: [laughs] There's nothing simple about it. Nothing simple about anything you've told me.
Jonathan: You don't believe us, do you?
Murray: I believe you, but that's not the problem. You don't need me to believe you. You need them to believe you.
Nancy: Them?
Murray: Them. With a capital "T." Your priest, your postman, your teacher, the world at large. [scoffs] They won't believe any of this.
Nancy: That's why we made the tape.
Murray: Oh. That's easy to bury. Easy.
Nancy: He admits it. You heard it. He admits culpability.
Murray: You're being naive, Nancy! Those people... [chuckles] They're not wired like me and you, okay? They don't spend their lives trying to get a look at what's behind the curtain. [chuckles] They like the curtain. It provides them stability, comfort, definition. This... this would open the curtain, and open the curtain behind that curtain, okay? So the minute someone with an ounce of authority calls bullshit, everyone will nod their heads and say, "See? Ha! I knew it! It was bullshit." That is, if you even get their attention at all.
Nancy: You're saying we did all of this for nothing?
Murray: I'm saying, I'm thinking. [sips his vodka] Ooh! [grunts]
[Murray goes back to the kitchen to add water]
Jonathan: This is ridiculous.
Murray: That's it. That's it!
Nancy: What's it?
Murray: It's just too strong. Too strong. [sips the drink] Better. [adds more water and sips] Perfect.
Nancy: We water it down.
Murray: Precisely.
Jonathan: Wait. What?
Murray: Your story. We moderate it. Just like this drink here. We make it more tolerable. Perhaps Barbara was exposed to some dangerous toxins.
Nancy:  A leak from the lab. Like Three Mile Island or something.
Murray: Something scary but familiar. [hands them both a drink] Close enough that it hits the man right where it hurts.
Nancy: And those assholes that killed Barb...
Murray: They'll go down.
[Nancy takes deep breath and drinks with Jonathan and Murray]
Owens: All right, what are we looking at?
Technician: This was some of the soil we took yesterday.
Owens: Okay. So what is your concern?
Technician: Well, we didn't find any signs of contamination. Uh, nothing hazardous other than some pesticides.
Owens: Well, it's a farm.
Technician: Right, right. Exactly. But...
[the technician leads Owens over to another technician]
[he lights a Bunsen burner and puts it under a beaker with soil in]
[the soil starts moving away from the heat almost like a tornado in the beaker]
[Owens sees that the other soil samples are copying]

Terry: I heard it. He was there.
Becky: Who was there?
Terry: He took her.
Becky: Don't take it out! Terry! Terry!
Terry: No! No! Please don't!
[nurse speaking indistinctly as Terry gets injected]
[cuts to later, Terry is opening a safe with files on the lab around her]
Terry: Three to the right. Four to the left.
[lock clicking]
[Terry sighs  and loads a revolver]
[indistinct chatter as Terry walks into the lab]
Security: Ma'am, can I see your badge?
Terry: Stay back. Stay back!
[gunshot as the security officer reaches for his gun]
[people scream]
[alarm blaring]
[Terry looks around the lab as people run]

Terry: Jane... No!
[security grab her and drag her away]
Terry: No! No! She's my child! No! She's my child! No! No. No.
[she grunts as she's strapped to a table]

[Joyce drives to where Bob mentioned the x is]
Mike: There's nothing. There's nothing here.
Joyce: Are... Are we close?
Bob: We're in the vicinity.
Joyce: What's that mean, the vicinity?
Bob: It means we're close. I don't know. It's not precise.
Joyce: But we did all that work.
Bob: I told you, the scale ratio is not exactly one-to-one. We needed to take-
Will: Turn right.
Joyce: What?
Will: I saw him.
Joyce: Where?
Will: Not here. In my now-memories.
Bob: In your what?

[Joyce panting as she climbs down into the hole]
Bob: Just going down the hole

Bob: We're actually inside of Will's map.
Joyce: Hopper!
Bob: How did he know all this?
Joyce: Bob! Over here! [stammers] It's his. [sighs] He's gotta be this way. Come on. [grunts] Hopper! 
Mike: Do you see anything? I mean, in your now-memories?
[tires screeching]
[Mike and Will turn and see the Hawkins vans approaching]
Joyce: Hopper! Hopper! 
Bob: What? This is...
Joyce: Oh! It's his arm.
[Joyce grunting as she pulls on the vines]
